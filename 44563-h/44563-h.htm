<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i-007.jpg" width="146" height="230" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">A LARGE portion of the public, and
especially that smaller section of the
community, the readers of books, will
not easily forget the shock, as universal
as it was unexpected, which
was produced at Christmas, 1863, by
the almost incredible intelligence of
the death of William Makepeace
Thackeray. The mournful news was
repeated at many a Christmas table,
that he, who had led the simple
Colonel Newcome to his solemn and touching end, would
write no more. The circumstance was so startling from
the suddenness of the great loss which society at large had
sustained, that it was some time before people could
realise the dismal truth of the report.</p>

<p>It will be easily understood, without elaborating on so
saddening a theme, with how much keener a blow this
heavy bereavement must have struck the surviving relatives
of the great novelist. It does not come within our
province to speak of the paralysing effect of such emotion;
it is sufficient to recall that Thackeray's death, with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">viii</a></span>
overwhelming sorrow, left, in the hour of their trial, his
two young daughters deprived of the fatherly active mind
which had previously shielded from them the graver
responsibilities of life, with the additional anxiety of being
forced to act in their own interests at the very time such
exertions were peculiarly distracting.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that the author of 'Vanity
Fair' had but recently erected, from his own designs, the
costly and handsome mansion in which he anticipated
passing the mellower years of his life; a dwelling in
every respect suited to the high standing of its owner,
and, as has been said by a brother writer, 'worthy of one
who really represented literature in the great world, and
who, planting himself on his books, yet sustained the
character of his profession with all the dignity of a gentleman.'</p>

<p>In such a house a portion of Thackeray's fortune might
be reasonably invested. To the occupant it promised the
enjoyment he was justified in anticipating, and was a solid
property to bequeath his descendants when age, in its
sober course, should have called him hence. But little
more than a year later, to those deadened with the effects
of so terrible a bereavement as their loss must have
proved when they could realise its fulness, this house must
have been a source of desolation. Its oppressive size, its
infinitely mournful associations, the hopeful expectations
with which it had been erected, the tragic manner in which
the one dearest to them had there been stricken down;
with all this acting on the sensibilities of unhealed grief,
the building must have impressed them with peculiar
aversion; and hence it may be concluded that their first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IX" id="Page_IX">ix</a></span>
desire was to leave it. The removal to a house of dimensions
more suitable to their requirements involved the
sacrifice of those portions of the contents of the larger
mansion with which it was considered expedient to dispense;
and thus Messrs. Christie, Manson, and Woods
announced for sale a selection from the paintings, drawings,
part of the interesting collection of curious porcelain,
and such various objects of art or furniture as would otherwise
have necessitated the continuance of a house as large
as that at Palace Green. These valuable objects were
accordingly dispersed under the hammer, March 16 and 17,
1864, and on the following day the remainder of Thackeray's
library was similarly offered to public competition.
To anyone familiar with Thackeray's writings, and more
especially with his Lectures and Essays, this collection of
books must have been both instructive and fascinating;
seeing that they faithfully indicated the course of their
owner's readings, and through them might be traced many
an allusion or curious fact of contemporaneous manners,
which, in the hands of this master of his craft, had been
felicitously employed to strengthen the purpose of some
passage of his own compositions.</p>

<p>Without converting this introduction into a catalogue
of the contents of Thackeray's library it is difficult to particularise
the several works found on his book-shelves. It
is sufficient to note that all the authorities which have been
quoted in his Essays were fitly represented; that such
books, in many instances obscure and trivial in themselves,
as threw any new or curious light upon persons or
things&mdash;on the private and individual, as well as the public
or political history of men, and of the events or writings to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_X" id="Page_X">x</a></span>
which their names owe notoriety, of obsolete fashions or of
the changing customs of society&mdash;were as numerous as the
most ardent and <i>dilettanti</i> of Thackeray's admirers could
desire.</p>

<p>The present volume is devised to give a notion, necessarily
restricted, of certain selections from these works,
chiefly chosen with a view of further illustrating the bent
of a mind, with the workings of which all who love the
great novelist's writings may at once be admitted to the
frankest intercourse. It has been truly said that Thackeray
was 'too great to conceal anything.' The same candour is
extended to his own copies of the books which told of
times and company wherein his imagination delighted to
dwell; for, pencil in hand, he has recorded the impressions
of the moment without reserve, whether whimsical or
realistic.</p>

<p>A collection of books of this character is doubly interesting.
On the one hand were found the remnants of
earlier humourists, the quaint old literary standards which
became, in the hands of their owner, materials from which
were derived the local colouring of the times concerning
which it was his delightful fancy to construct romances, to
philosophise, or to record seriously.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the present generation was fitly
represented. To most of the writers of his own era it was
an honour that a presentation copy of their literary offspring
should be found in the library of the foremost
author, whose friendship and open-handed kindness to the
members of his profession was one of many brilliant traits
of a character dignified by innumerable great qualities, and
tenderly shaded by instances uncountable of generous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XI" id="Page_XI">xi</a></span>
readiness to confer benefits, and modest reticence to let the
fame of his goodness go forth.</p>

<p>Presentation copies from his contemporaries were therefore
not scarce; and whether the names of the donors were
eminent, or as yet but little heard of, the creatures of their
thoughts had been preserved with unvarying respect. The
'Christmas Carol,' that memorable Christmas gift which
Thackeray has praised with fervour unusual even to his
impetuous good-nature, was one of the books. The copy,
doubly interesting from the circumstances both of its
authorship and ownership, was inscribed in the well-known
hand of that other great novelist of the nineteenth century,
'W. M. Thackeray, from Charles Dickens (<i>whom he made
very happy once a long way from home</i>).' Competition was
eager to secure this covetable literary memorial, which
may one day become historical; it was knocked down at
25<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, and rumour circulated through the press, without
foundation, we believe with regret, that it had been secured
for the highest personage in the State, whose desire to
possess this volume would have been a royal compliment
to the community of letters.</p>

<p>Nor were books with histories wanting. George Augustus
Sala, in the introduction to his ingenious series of
'Twice Round the Clock,' published in 1862, remarks with
diffidence: 'It would be a piece of sorry vanity on my part
to imagine that the conception of a Day and Night in London
is original. I will tell you how I came to think of the
scheme of "Twice Round the Clock." Four years ago, in
Paris, my then master in literature, Mr. Charles Dickens,
lent me a little thin octavo volume, which I believe had
been presented to him by another master of the craft, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XII" id="Page_XII">xii</a></span>
Thackeray.' A slight resemblance to this opuscule was
offered in 'A View of the Transactions of London and
Westminster from the Hours of Ten in the Evening till
Five in the Morning,' which was secured at Thackeray's
sale for forty-four shillings.</p>

<p>Thus, without presuming to any special privileges, we
account for the selection of literary curiosities which form
settings for the fragments gathered in 'Thackerayana,'
The point of interest which rendered this dispersion of certain
of Thackeray's books additionally attractive to us may
be briefly set forth.</p>

<p>In looking through the pages of odd little volumes, and
on the margins and fly-leaves of some of the choicest
works, presentation copies or otherwise, it was noticed that
pencil or pen-and-ink sketches, of faithful conceptions suggested
by the texts, touched in most cases with remarkable
neatness and decision, were abundantly dispersed through
various series.</p>

<p>It is notorious that their owner's gift of dexterous
sketching was marvellous; his rapid facility, in the minds
of those critics who knew him intimately, was the one great
impediment to any serious advancement in those branches
of art which demand a lengthy probationship; and to this
may be referred his implied failure, or but partial success,
in the art which, to him, was of all cultivated accomplishments
the most enticing. The fact has been dwelt on
gravely by his friends, and was a source of regret to certain
eminent artists best acquainted with his remarkable
endowments.</p>

<p>The chance of securing as many of these characteristic
designs as was in our power directed the selection of books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIII" id="Page_XIII">xiii</a></span>
which came into our possession in consequence of the sale
of Thackeray's library; it was found they were richer in
these clever pencillings than had been anticipated.</p>

<p>An impulse thus given, the excitement of increasing
the little gathering was carried further; many volumes
which had been dispersed were traced, or were offered
spontaneously when the fact of the collection became
known. From books wherein, pencil in hand, passages had
been noted with sprightly little vignettes, not unlike the
telling etchings which the author of 'Vanity Fair' caused
to be inserted in his own published works, we became
desirous of following the evidence of this faculty through
other channels; seeing we held the Alpha, as it were,
inserted in the Charterhouse School books, and the later
pencillings, which might enliven any work of the hour
indifferently, as it excited the imagination, grotesque or
artist-like, as the case might be, of the original reader,
whether the book happened to be a modest magazine in
paper or an <i>édition de luxe</i> in morocco.</p>

<p>A demand created, the supply, though of necessity
limited, was for a time forthcoming. The energy, which
fosters a mania for collecting, was aided by one of those
unlooked-for chances which sustain such pursuits, and,
from such congenial sources as the early companions of
the author, sufficient material came into our possession to
enable us to trace Thackeray's graphic ambition throughout
his career with an approach to consistency, following
his efforts in this direction through his school days, in
boyish diversions, and among early favourites of fiction; as
an undergraduate of Cambridge; on trips to Paris; as a
student at Weimar and about Germany; through magazines,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">xiv</a></span>
to Paris, studying in the Louvre; to Rome, dwelling
among artists; through his contributions to 'Fraser's,' and
that costly abortive newspaper speculation the 'Constitutional;'
through the slashing Bohemian days, to the
period of 'Vanity Fair;' through successes, repeated and
sustained&mdash;Lectures and Essays; through travels at home
and abroad&mdash;to America, from Cornhill to Grand Cairo, to
Scotland, to Ireland, 'Up the Rhine,' Switzerland, Italy,
Belgium, Holland, and wherever Roundabout 'sketches by
the way' might present themselves.</p>

<p>The study which had attracted an individual, elicited
the sympathy of a larger circle. The many who preserve
mementos similar to those dispersed through 'Thackerayana'
enlarged on the general interest of the materials,
and especially upon the gratification which that part of the
public representing Thackeray's admirers would discover
in such original memorials of our eminent novelist; and
which, from the nature of his gifts, and the almost unique
propensity for their exercise, would be impossible in the
case of almost any other man of kindred genius.</p>

<p>Selections from the sketches were accordingly produced
in <i>facsimile</i>, only such subjects being used as, from their
relation to the context, derived sufficient coherence to be
generally appreciable.</p>

<p>The writer is aware that many such memorials exist,
some of them unquestionably of greater worth in themselves
than several that are found in the present gathering;
but it is not probable, either from their private nature, the
circumstances of their ownership, or from the fact that, in
their isolated condition, they do not illustrate any particular
stage of their author's progress, that the public will ever
become familiar with them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XV" id="Page_XV">xv</a></span></p>

<p>'Thackerayana' is issued with a sense of imperfections;
many more finished or pretentious drawings might have
been offered, but the illustrations have been culled with a
sense of their fitness to the subject in view. It is the
intention to present Thackeray in the aspect his ambition
preferred&mdash;as a sketcher; his pencil and pen bequeath us
matter to follow his career; we recognise that delightful
gift, a facility for making rapid little pictures on the inspiration
of the moment; it is an endless source of pleasure to
the person who may exercise this faculty, and treasures up
the most abundant and life-like reminiscences for the delectation
of others. It will be understood as no implied
disparagement of more laboured masterpieces if we observe
that the composition of historical works, the conception
and execution of <i>chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</i>, are grave, lengthy, and
systematic operations, not to be lightly intruded on; they
involve much time and preparation, many essays, failures,
alterations, corrections, much grouping of accessories,
posing of models, and setting of lay-figures; they become
oppressive after a time, and demand a strain of absorption
to accomplish, and an effort of mind to appreciate, which
are not to be daily exerted; long intervals are required to
recruit after such labours; but the bright, ready <i>croquis</i> of
the instant, if not profound, embalms the life that is passing
and incessant; the incident too fleeting to be preserved on
the canvas, or in a more ambitious walk of the art, lives in
the little sketch-book; it is grateful to the hand which jots
it down, and has the agreeable result of being able to
extend that pleasure to all who may glance therein. If it
was one of Thackeray's few fanciful griefs that he was not
destined for a painter of the grand order, it doubtless consoled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVI" id="Page_XVI">xvi</a></span>
him to find that the happier gift of embodying that
abstract creation&mdash;an idea&mdash;in a few strokes of the pencil
was his beyond all question; and this graceful faculty he
was accustomed to exercise so industriously, that myriads of
examples survive of the originality of his invention as an
artist, in addition to the brilliant fancy and sterling truth
to be found in his works as an author.</p>

</div>

<p>The fondness of Thackeray for lingering
amidst the scenes of a boy's daily life in a
public grammar school, has generally been
attributed to his early education at the
Charterhouse, that celebrated monastic-looking
establishment in the neighbourhood
of Smithfield, which he scarcely disguised
from his readers as
the original of the familiar
'Greyfriars' of his works
of fiction. Most of our
novelists have given us in
various forms their school
reminiscences; but none
have produced them so
frequently, or dwelt upon
them with such manifest
bias towards the subject,
as the author of 'Vanity
Fair,' 'The Newcomes,'
and 'The Adventures of
Philip.' It is pleasing to think that this habit, which Thackeray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
was well aware had been frequently censured by his critics as
carried to excess, was, like his partiality for the times of Queen
Anne and the Georges, in some degree due to the traditional reverence
of his family for the memory of their great-grandfather,
Dr. Thomas Thackeray, the well-remembered head-master of
Harrow.</p>

<p>Sketches of Indian life and Anglo-Indians generally are abundantly
interspersed through Mr. Thackeray's writings, but he left
India too early to have profited much by Indian experiences. He
is said, however, to have retained so strong an impression of the
scene of his early childhood, as to have wished in later life to revisit
it, and recall such things as were still
remembered by him. In his seventh
year he was sent to England, and when
the ship touched at St. Helena, he was
taken up to have a glimpse of Bowood,
and there saw that great Captain at
whose name the rulers of the earth had so often trembled. It is
remarkable that in his little account of the second funeral of Napoleon,
which he witnessed in Paris in 1840, no allusion to this
fact appears; but he himself has described it in one of his latest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
works&mdash;the lectures on 'The Four Georges,' first delivered in
the United States in 1855-56, and afterwards described by the
<i>Athenæum</i> as 'an airy, humorous, and brilliant picture of English
life and manners, produced by honest reading out of many books,
and lighted with the glow of individual sympathy and intellect.'</p>

<p>We fancy that Thackeray was placed under the protection of
his grandfather, William Makepeace Thackeray, who had settled
with a good fortune, the fruit of his industry in India, at Hadley,
near Chipping Barnet, a little village, in the churchyard of which
lies buried the once-read Mrs. Chapone, the authoress of the
'Letters on the Improvement of the Mind,' the correspondent
of Richardson, and the intimate friend of the learned Mrs. Carter
and other blue-stocking ladies of that time.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-026.jpg" width="129" height="329" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A Man of Letters</p>
</div>
<p>In the course of time&mdash;we believe in his twelfth year&mdash;Thackeray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
was sent to the Charterhouse School, and remained there as
a boarder in the house of Mr. Penny. He appears in the Charterhouse
records for the year 1822 as a boy on the tenth form. In
the next year we find him promoted to the
seventh form; in 1824 to the fifth; and in
1828, when he had become a day-boy, or
one residing with his friends, we find him in
the honourable positions of a first-form boy
and one of the monitors of the school. He
was, however, never chosen as one of the
orators, or those who speak the oration on the
Founder's Day, nor does he appear among the
writers of the Charterhouse odes, which have
been collected and printed from time to time
in a small volume. We need feel no surprise
that Thackeray's ambition did not lead him
to seek this sort of distinction; like most
keen humorists, he preferred exercising his
powers of satire in burlesquing these somewhat
trite compositions to contributing
seriously to swell their numbers. Prize
poems ever yielded the novelist a delightful
field for his sarcasms.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Early efforts at Drawing</p>
</div>

<p>While pursuing his studies at 'Smiffle,'
as the Carthusians were pleased to style
'Greyfriars,' Thackeray gave abundant evidences
of the gifts that were in him. He scribbled juvenile verses,
towards the close of his school days, displaying taste for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
healthy sarcasm which afterwards became one of his distinctive
qualities, at the expense of the prosaic compositions set down as
school verses. In one of his class books, 'Thucydides,' with his
autograph, 'Charter House, 1827,' are scribbled two verses in
which the tender passion is treated somewhat realistically:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Love 's like a mutton chop,</p>
<p class="i1">Soon it grows cold;</p>
<p>All its attractions hop</p>
<p class="i1">Ere it grows old.</p>
<p>Love 's like the cholic sure,</p>
<p>Both painful to endure;</p>
<p>Brandy 's for both a cure,</p>
<p class="i1">So I've been told.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>When for some fair the swain</p>
<p class="i1">Burns with desire,</p>

<p class="i1">Eager to try her,</p>
<p>He weds as soon as he can,</p>
<p>And jumps&mdash;unhappy man&mdash;</p>
<p>Out of the frying pan</p>
<p class="i1">Into the fire.</p>
</div></div></div>

</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-027-copy.jpg" width="86" height="130" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As to the humorist's pencil, even throughout these early days, it
must have been an unfailing source of delight, not only to the owner
but to the companions of his form. 'Draw us some pictures,' the
boys would say; and straightway
down popped a caricature of a
master on slate or exercise paper.
Then school books were brought
into requisition, and the fly-leaves
were adorned with whimsical
travesties of the subjects of their
contents. Abbé Barthélemy's
'Travels of Anacharsis the
Younger' suggested the figure of a wandering minstrel, with battered
hat and dislocated flageolet, piping his way through the world in
the dejected fashion in which those forlorn pilgrims might have
presented themselves to the charitable dwellers in Charterhouse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Square; while Anacharsis, Junior, habited in classic guise, was sent
(pictorially) tramping the high road from Scythia to Athens, with
stick and bundle over his back, a wallet
at his side, sporting a family umbrella
of the defunct 'gingham' species as a
staff, and furnished with lace-up hob-nailed
boots of the shape, size, and
weight popularly approved by navvies.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-028-copy.jpg" width="144" height="127" alt="" />
<p class="caption">'A Gingham'</p>
</div>

<p>Then Ainsworth's Latin Dictionary
was turned into a sketch book, and supplemented
with studies of head-masters,
early conceptions of Roman warriors,
primitive Carthusians indulging disrespectful gestures, known as
'sights,' at the rears of respectable governors, and boys of the
neighbouring 'blue coat' foundation, their costume completed
with the addition of a fool's or dunce's long-eared cap.</p>

<p>Fantastic designs, even when marked by the early graphic
talent which Thackeray's rudest scribblings display, are apt to entail
unpleasant consequences when discovered in school-books,
and greater attractions were held
out by works of fiction.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-028.jpg" width="175" height="230" alt="" />
<p class="caption">In a state of suspense</p>
</div>

<p>Pages of knight-errantry were
the things for inspiration: Quixote,
Orlando Furioso, Valentine
and Orson, the Seven Champions,
Cyrus the Grand (and interminable),
mystic and chivalrous legends,
quite forgotten in our
generation, but which, in Thackeray's
boyhood, were considered
fascinating reading;&mdash;quaint romances,
Italian, Spanish, and Persian
tales, familiar enough in those
days, and oft referred to, with accents
of tender regret, in the reminiscences
of the great novelist.
What charms did the 'Arabian Nights' hold out for his kindling
imagination,&mdash;how frequently were its heroes and its episodes
brought in to supply some apt allusion in his later writings! It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
seems that Thackeray's pencil never tired of his favourite stories
in the 'Thousand and One Nights,' precious to him for preserving
ever green the impressions of boyhood. How numerous his unpublished
designs from these tales, those who treasure his numberless
and diversified sketches can alone tell. We see the thrilling
episode of 'Ali Baba' perched among the branches, while the
robbers bear their spoil to the mysterious cave, repeated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
unvarying interest, and each time with some fresh point of humour
to give value to the slight tracings.</p>

<p>'Make us some faces,' his school-companions would cry.
'Whom will you have? name your friends,' says the young artist.
Perhaps one young rogue, with a
schoolboy's taste for personalities,
will cry, 'Old Buggins;' and the
junior Buggins blushes and fidgets
as the ideal presentment of his progenitor
is rapidly dashed off and
held up to the appreciation of a
circle of rapturous critics. 'Now,'
says the wounded youngster, glad to
retaliate, 'you remember old Figgins'
pater when he brought Old
Figs back and forgot to tip&mdash;draw

that economic civic ornament is
produced from recollection.</p>

<p>Holidays came, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
with them the chance of visiting the theatres. Think of the
plays in fashion between 1820 and '30; what juvenile rejoicings
over the moral drama, over the wicked earl unmasked in the
last Act, the persecuted maiden triumphant, and virtue's defenders
rewarded. Recall the pieces in vogue in those early days, to
which the novelist refers with constant pleasure; how does he
write of nautical melodramas, of 'Black Ey'd Seusan,' and such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
simply constructed pieces as he has parodied in the pages of
'Punch:' such as Theodore Hook is described hitting off on
the piano after dinner. Think of Sadler's Wells, and the real
water, turned on from the New River adjacent. Remember Astley's,
and its gallant stud of horses. How faded are all these glories in
our time, yet they were gorgeous subjects for young Thackeray's
hand to work out; and we can well conceive eager little Cistercians,
in miniature black gowns and breeches, revelling over the splendid
pictures, perhaps made more glorious with the colour box. How
many of these scraps have been treasured to this day, and are now
gone with the holders, heaven knows where?</p>

Incledon, and the jovial rollicking tuneful 'Beggar's Opera.'

<p>Thackeray's predilections for the stage survived the first flush of

<p>The references made by
Thackeray to the romances
which thrilled the sympathies
of novel-readers in his
youth are spread throughout
his writings. In the 'Roundabout
Paper' devoted to
reminiscences of fictions
which delighted his schooldays,
he whimsically deplores
that Time, among other insatiable
propensities, should
devour the glories of novels,
and especially of those which have befriended his youth; that
no friendly hand should take the volumes down from their long
rest on the library shelves; that the profits of the forlorn novelists
should dwindle infinitesimally as the popularity of their bantlings
fades, until limbo finally takes them into indefinite keeping.</p>

<p>In another paper, 'De Juventate,' he makes an earlier record
of his partiality for the imaginary companions of his boyhood.
After alluding to the games of his time, which he finds little
changed, Mr. Roundabout reverts to his favourite old novels,
and challenges the present day to rival their attractions, as far as
his boyish imagination was concerned. 'O "Scottish Chiefs,"
didn't we weep over you? O "Mysteries of Udolpho," didn't I
and Briggs minor draw pictures out of you, as I have said?'</p>

<p>On the title-page of one of his old class-books, 'The Eton
Latin Grammar,' we find fanciful scribblings, in the manner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Skelt's once famous theatrical characters, of schoolboy versions
of Sir William Wallace triumphing over the fallen Sir Aymer
de Valence, while Thaddeus of Warsaw, attired in a square Polish
cap, laced jacket, tights, and Hessian boots, his belt stuck round
with pistols, is gallantly flourishing a curly sabre.</p>

<p>Sketches of this picturesque nature seem to have held a
certain charm over the novelist's fancy through life; the impressions
of his boyhood are jotted down in all sorts of melodramatic
fragments.</p>

<p>Similar reminiscences, applying to different stages of our
writer's career, and forming portions of the illustrations to
'Thackerayana,' will be recognised throughout this work.</p>

<p>We endeavour to trace sufficient of the thread of the once
familiar story of 'The Castle of Otranto' (published in 1782, the
fourth edition), enlivened with highly droll marginal pencillings,
to assist our readers in a ready appreciation of the point and character
of the little designs, as it is more than probable that, by
this time, the interest and incidents of the original fiction are
somewhat obscured in the memories of our readers. We follow
the words of the author as closely as possible.</p>

<p>'Manfred, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter.
The latter, a most beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called
Matilda. Conrad, the son, was only fifteen, and of a sickly constitution;
he was the hope of his father, who had contracted a
marriage for him with the Marquis of Vicenza's daughter, Isabella.
The bride elect had been delivered by the guardians into Manfred's
hands, that the marriage might take place as soon as Conrad's
infirm health would permit it. The impatience of the prince
for the completion of this ceremonial was attributed to his
dread of seeing an ancient prophecy accomplished, which pronounced&mdash;"that
the Castle and Lordship of Otranto should pass
from the present family, whenever the real owner should be
grown too large to inhabit it."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-042.jpg" width="274" height="396" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Young Conrad's birthday was fixed for the marriage; the
company were assembled in the chapel of the castle, everything
ready,&mdash;but the bridegroom was missing! The prince, in alarm,
went in search of his son. The first object that struck Manfred's
eyes was a group of his servants endeavouring to raise something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
that appeared to him a mountain of sable plumes. "What are
ye doing?" he cried, wrathfully; "where is my son?" A volley of
voices replied, "Oh! my lord! the prince! the helmet! the
helmet!" Shocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading
he knew not what, he advanced hastily,&mdash;but what a sight for a
father's eyes! He beheld his child dashed to pieces, and almost
buried under an enormous helmet, a hundred times larger than
any casque ever made for human being, and shaded with a proportionable
quantity of black feathers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-043-copy-2.jpg" width="199" height="131" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'The consternation produced by this murderous apparition did
not diminish. Isabella was, however, relieved at her escape from
an ill-assorted union. Manfred continued to
gaze at the terrible casque. No one could explain
its presence. In the midst of their senseless
guesses, a young peasant, whom rumour had
drawn thither from a neighbouring village, observed
that the miraculous helmet was like that
on the figure in black marble, in the church
of St. Nicholas, of Alonzo the Good (the original
Prince of Otranto, who died without leaving an ascertained heir,
and whose steward, Manfred's grandfather, had illegally contrived
to obtain possession of the castle, estates, and title). "Villain!
what sayest thou?" cried Manfred, starting from
his trance in a tempest of rage, and seizing the
young man by the collar. "How darest thou
utter such treason? Thy life shall pay for it!"
The peasant was secured, and confined, as a
necromancer, under the gigantic helmet, there
to be starved to death. Manfred retired to his
chamber to meditate in solitude over the blow
which had descended on his house. His gentle
daughter, Matilda, heard his disordered footsteps.
She was just going to beg admittance, when Manfred suddenly opened
the door; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the disorder of
his mind, he did not distinguish the person, but asked angrily who
it was. Matilda replied, trembling,
"My dearest father, it
is I, your daughter." Manfred,
stepping back hastily,
cried, "Begone, I do not want
a daughter;" and flinging back
abruptly, clapped the door
against the terrified Matilda.
His dejected daughter returned
to her mother, the pious Hippolita, who was being comforted
by Isabella. A servant, on the part of Manfred, informed the
latter that Manfred demanded to speak with her. "With me!"
cried Isabella. "Go," said Hippolita, "console him, and tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
him that I will smother my own anguish rather than add to
his."</p>

<div class="figright">

</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-044-copy.jpg" width="170" height="135" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'As it was now evening, the servant, who conducted Isabella,
bore a torch before her. When they came to Manfred, who was
walking impatiently about the
gallery, he started, and said
hastily, "Take away that light,
and begone." Then, shutting
the door impetuously, he flung
himself upon a bench against
the wall, and bade Isabella sit
by him. She obeyed trembling.
The iniquitous Manfred
then proposed, that as his son
was dead, Isabella should espouse him instead, and he would
divorce the virtuous Hippolita. Manfred, on her refusal, resorted
to violence, when the plumes of the
fatal helmet suddenly waved to and
fro tempestuously in the moonlight.
Manfred, disregarding the portent,
cried&mdash;"Heaven nor hell shall impede
my designs," and advanced to
seize the princess. At that instant
the portrait of his grandfather, which
hung over the bench where they had
been sitting, uttered a deep sigh,
and heaved its breast. Manfred was distracted between his pursuit
of Isabella and the aspect of the picture, which quitted its
panel and stepped on the floor with a grave and melancholy air.
The vision sighed and made a sign to Manfred to follow him.
"Lead on!" cried Manfred; "I will follow thee to the gulph of
perdition." The spectre marched sedately, but dejected, to the end
of the gallery. Manfred followed, full of anxiety and horror, but
resolved. The spectre retired. Isabella had fled to a subterranean
passage leading from the Castle to the Sanctuary of St. Nicholas.
In this vault she encountered the young peasant who had provoked
the animosity of Manfred. He lifted up a secret trap-door, and
Isabella made her escape; but Manfred and his followers prevented
the flight of the daring stranger. The prince, who expected to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
secure Isabella, was considerably startled to discover this youth in
her stead. The weight of the helmet had broken the pavement
above, and he had thus alighted in time to assist Isabella, whose
disappearance he denied. A noise of voices startled Manfred, who
was alarmed by fresh indications of hostile evidences. Jacques
and Diego, two of his retainers, detailed the fresh cause of alarm.
It was thus: they had heard a noise&mdash;they opened a door and ran
back, their hair standing on end with terror.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-045.jpg" width="326" height="116" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-045-copy.jpg" width="69" height="96" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'"It is a giant, I believe," said Diego; "he is all clad in armour,
for I saw his foot and part of his leg, and they are as large as the
helmet below in the court. We heard a violent motion, and the
rattling of armour, as if the giant was rising. Before we could get
to the end of the gallery we heard the door of the great chamber
clap behind us; but for Heaven's sake, good my lord, send for
the chaplain and have the place exorcised, for it is certainly
haunted." The attendants searched for Isabella in vain. The
next morning father Jerome arrived, announcing that she had
taken refuge at the altar of St. Nicholas. He came to inform
Hippolita of the perfidy of her husband. Manfred prevented him,
saying, "I do not use to let my wife be acquainted
with the affairs of my state; they are not within
a woman's province." "My Lord," said the holy
man, "I am no intruder into the secrets of families.
My office is to promote peace and teach mankind
to curb their headstrong passions. I forgive
your highness's uncharitable apostrophe; I know
my duty, and am the minister of a mightier Prince than Manfred.
Hearken to Him who speaks through my organs." The good
father&mdash;to divert Manfred by a subterfuge from his unhallowed designs&mdash;suggested
that there might, perhaps, be an attachment between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the peasant and his recluse. Manfred was so enraged that he
ordered the youth who defied him to be executed forthwith. The
removal of the peasant's doublet disclosed the mark of a bloody arrow.
"Gracious Heaven!" cried the priest, starting, "what do I see? it
is my child! my Theodore!" Manfred was deaf to the prayers of
the father and friar, and ordered the tragedy to proceed. "A
saint's bastard may be no saint himself," said the prince sternly.
The friar exclaimed, "His blood is noble; he is my lawful son, and
I am the Count of Falconara!" At this critical
juncture the tramp of horses was heard, the
sable plumes of the enchanted helmet were
again agitated, and a brazen trumpet was sounded
without. "Father," said Manfred, "do you go to
the wicket and demand who is at the gate." "Do
you grant me the life of Theodore?" replied
the friar. "I do," said the prince. The new
arrival was a herald from the Knight of the
Gigantic Sabre, who requested to speak with the Usurper of Otranto.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-046.jpg" width="88" height="120" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Manfred was enraged at this message; he ordered Jerome to
be thrust out, and to reconduct Isabella to the castle, and commanded
Theodore to be confined in the black tower. He then
directed the herald to be admitted to his presence.</p>

<p>'"Well! thou insolent!" said the prince, "what wouldst thou
with me?" "I come," replied he, "to thee, Manfred, usurper of
the principality of Otranto, from the renowned and invincible
knight, the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre: in the name of his Lord,
Frederic, Marquis of Vicenza, he demands the Lady Isabella,
daughter of that prince whom thou hast basely and treacherously
got into thy power, by bribing her false guardians during his
absence; he requires thee to resign the principality of Otranto,
which thou hast usurped from the said Lord Frederic, the nearest
of blood to the last rightful Lord Alonzo the Good. If thou dost
not instantly comply with these just demands, he defies thee to
single combat to the last extremity." And so saying, the herald
cast down his warder. Manfred knew how well founded this claim
was; indeed, his object in seeking an alliance with Isabella had
been to unite the claimants in one interest.</p>

<p>'The herald was despatched to bid the champions welcome, and
the prince ordered the gates to be flung open for the reception of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the stranger knight and his retinue. In a few minutes the cavalcade
arrived. First came two harbingers with wands. Next a
herald, followed by two pages and two trumpets. Then a hundred
foot-guards. These were attended by as many horse. After them
fifty foot-men clothed in scarlet and black, the colours of the
knight. Then a led horse. Two heralds on each side of a gentleman
on horseback bearing a banner with the arms of Vicenza and
Otranto quarterly&mdash;a circumstance that much offended Manfred,
but he stifled his resentment. Two more pages. The knight's
confessor telling his beads. Fifty more foot-men clad as before.
Two knights habited in complete armour, their beavers down,
comrades to the principal knight. The squires of the two knights,
carrying their shields and devices. The knight's own squire. A
hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword, and seeming to
faint under the weight of it. The knight himself on a chestnut steed,
in complete armour, his lance in the rest, his face entirely concealed
by his vizor, which was surmounted by a large plume of scarlet and
black feathers. Fifty foot-guards, with drums and trumpets,
closed the procession. Manfred invited the train to enter the great
hall of his castle. He proposed to the stranger to disarm, but the
knight shook his head in token of refusal. "Rest here," said Manfred;
"I will but give orders for the accommodation of your train,
and return to you." The three knights bowed as accepting his
courtesy. Manfred directed the stranger's retinue to be conducted
to an adjacent hospital, founded by the Princess Hippolita for the
reception of pilgrims. As they made the circuit of the court, the
gigantic sword burst from the supporters, and falling to the ground
opposite the helmet, remained immovable.</p>

<p>'Manfred, almost hardened to supernatural appearances, surmounted
the shock of this new prodigy; and returning to the hall,
where by this time the feast was
ready, he invited his silent guests to
take their places. Manfred, however
ill at ease was his heart, endeavoured
to inspire the company with mirth.
He put several questions to them,
but was answered only by signs.
They raised their vizors but sufficiently
to feed themselves, and that
sparingly. During the parley Father
Jerome hurried in to report the disappearance of Isabella. The
knights and their retinue dispersed to search the neighbourhood,
and Manfred, with his vassals, quitted the castle to confuse their
movements. Theodore was still confined in the black tower, but
his guards were gone. The gentle Matilda came to his assistance;
she carried him to her father's armoury, and having equipped
him with a complete suit, conducted him to the postern-gate.
"Avoid the town," said the princess, "but hie thee to the opposite
quarter; yonder is a chain of rocks, hollowed into a labyrinth of
caverns that lead to the sea-coast. Go! Heaven be thy guide!
and sometimes, in thy prayers, remember Matilda!" Theodore
flung himself at her feet, and seizing
her lily hand, which with struggles
she suffered him to kiss, he vowed
on the earliest opportunity to get
himself knighted, and fervently intreated
her permission to swear himself
eternally her champion. He
then sighed and retired, but with
eyes fixed on the gate, until Matilda,
closing it, put an end to an interview, in which the hearts of both
had drunk so deeply of a passion which both now tasted for the

<p>We must now crowd the sequel of this remarkable story into
the smallest possible space. In the caverns Theodore recovered
the distracted Isabella; but a knight arrived at the moment of his
happy discovery, and mistrusting her deliverer, while Theodore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
deceived himself as to the intentions of the stranger, a desperate
combat ensued, and the younger champion gained the victory. The
stranger knight explained his mistake, and revealed himself as the
missing Marquis of Vicenza, father to Isabella, and nearest heir
to Alonzo. He anticipated his wounds were fatal, but he recovered
at the castle. Manfred artfully pursued his unholy designs for a
union with Isabella. He gave a great feast, with this object, but
Theodore withdrew from the revelry to pray with Matilda at the
tomb of Alonzo. Manfred followed him to the chapel, believing
his companion was Isabella, and struck his dagger through the
heart of his daughter. He was overwhelmed with remorse for his
error, on discovering that he had murdered his child. Theodore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
revealed to Frederic that he was the real and rightful successor to
Alonzo. This declaration was confirmed by the apparition of
Alonzo. Thunder and a clank of more than mortal armour was
heard. The walls of the
castle behind Manfred
were thrown down with
a mighty force, and the
form of Alonzo, dilated
to an immense magnitude,
appeared in the
centre of the ruins. 'Behold
in Theodore the true
heir of Alonzo!' said the
vision, and, ascending solemnly
towards heaven, the
clouds parted asunder, and
the form of St. Nicholas
received Alonzo's shade.
Manfred confessed, in his
terror, that Alonzo had
been poisoned by his grandfather,
and a fictitious will
had accomplished his treacherous
end. Jerome further
revealed that Alonzo had secretly
espoused Victoria, a Sicilian virgin.
After the good knight's decease a daughter
was born. Her hand had been bestowed
on him, the disguised Count of
Falconara. Theodore was the fruit of
their marriage, thus establishing his direct
right to the principality. Manfred
and his virtuous wife, Hippolita, retired
to neighbouring convents. Frederic
offered his daughter to the new prince,
but 'it was not until after frequent discourses
with Isabella of dear Matilda that he was persuaded he
could know no happiness but in the society of one with whom
he could for ever indulge the melancholy that had taken possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
of his soul,' with which cheerful prospect the 'Castle of
Otranto' is brought to an appropriate conclusion.</p>

by 'Rollin's Ancient History,' one of the books of which we

the more tempting passages of the eight volumes forming the particular
edition in question, to which a fresh interest is contributed

<p>'Until the reign of Psammeticus the Egyptians
were believed to be the most ancient
people on the earth. Wishing to assure themselves
of this antiquity, they employed a most
remarkable test, if the statement is worthy of credit. Two children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
just born of poor parents, were shut up in two separate
cabins in the country, and a shepherd was directed to feed them
on goat's milk. (Others state that they were nourished by nurses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
whose tongues had been cut out.) No one was permitted to enter
the cabins, and no word was ever allowed to be pronounced in
their presence. One day,
when these children arrived at
the age of two years, the shepherd
entered to bring them
their usual food, when each of
them, from their different divisions,
extending their hands
to the keeper, cried, "Beccos,
beccos." This word, it was
discovered, was employed by the Phrygians to signify bread; and
since that period this nation has enjoyed, above all other peoples,
the honour of the earliest antiquity.'&mdash;Vol. I. p. 162.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">History of the Carthaginians, etc. etc.</span></h4>

<p>'... Virgil has greatly altered many facts in his "History of
the Carthaginians," by the supposition that his hero, Æneas, was a
contemporary of Dido, although there
is an interval of about three centuries
between the two personages; Carthage
having been built nearly three hundred
years before
the Fall of
Troy.'&mdash;Vol. I.

<p>'... By the
order of Hannibal a road was excavated
through the bed of the rocks, and this
labour was carried on with astonishing
vigour and perseverance. To open and
enlarge this pathway they felled all the
trees in the adjoining parts, and as soon
as the timber was cut down the soldiers
arranged the trunks on all sides of the
rocks, and the wood was then set on fire.
Fortunately, there being a high wind, an ardent flame was quickly
kindled, until the rock glowed with heat as fiery as the furnace burning
round it. Hannibal&mdash;if we may credit Titus Livius (for Polybius<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
does not mention the circumstance)&mdash;then caused a great quantity
of vinegar to be poured upon the heated stone, which ran into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
the fissures of the rocks (already cracked by the heat of the fire),
and caused them to soften and calcine to powder. By this contrivance
he prepared a road through the heart of the mountains,
giving easy passage to his troops, their baggage, and even their
elephants.'&mdash;Vol. I. p. 406.</p>

<p>'Cr&oelig;sus, wishing to assure himself of the veracity of the different
oracles, sent deputies to consult the most celebrated soothsayers
both in Africa and in Greece, with orders to inform themselves
how Cr&oelig;sus was engaged at a certain hour on a day that
was pointed out to them.</p>

<p>'His instructions were exactly carried out. The oracle of
Delphi returned the only correct reply. It was given in verses of
the hexameter metre, and was in substance:
"I know the number of grains
of sand in the sea, and the measure of
the vast deep. I understand the dumb,
and those who have not learned to
speak. My senses are saluted with the
savoury odour of a turtle stewed with
the flesh of lambs in a brazier, which
has copper on all sides, above and
below!"</p>

<p>'In fact the king, desiring to select
some employment which it would be
impossible to divine, had occupied himself
at the hour appointed for the revelation
in preparing a turtle and a lamb in a copper stewpan,
which had also a lid of copper.'&mdash;Vol. II. p. 129.

<p>'... When the people of Ionia and Æolia learnt that Cyrus
had mastered the Lydians, they despatched ambassadors to him
at Sardis, proposing to be received into his empire, under the same
conditions as he had accorded to the Lydians. Cyrus, who before
his victories had vainly solicited them to
unite in his cause, and who now found
himself in a position to constrain them by
force, gave as his only answer the apologue
of a fisherman, who, having tried to lure
the fish with the notes of his flute, without
any success, had recourse to his net as the
shortest method of securing them.'&mdash;Vol.

<p>'Herodotus, and after him Justinian, recounts
that Astyages, King of the Medes,
on the impressions of an alarming dream,
which announced that a child his daughter
was to bear would dethrone him, gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Mandane, his daughter, in marriage to a Persian of obscure birth
and condition, named Cambyses. A son being born of this marriage,
the king charged Harpagus, one of his principal officers, to
put the child to death. Harpagus gave him to one of his shepherds
to be exposed in a forest. However, the infant, being
miraculously preserved, and afterwards nourished in secret by the
herd's wife, was at last recognised by his royal grandfather, who
contented himself by his removal to the centre of Persia, and
vented all his fury on the unhappy officer, whose own son he
caused to be served up, to be eaten by him at a feast. Some
years later the young Cyrus was informed by Harpagus of the
circumstances of his birth and position; animated by his counsels
and remonstrances, he raised an army in Persia, marched against
Astyages, and challenged him to battle. The sovereignty of the
empire thus passed from the hands of the Medes to the Persians.'&mdash;Vol.

<h4><span class="smcap">Ancient History of Greece.</span></h4>

<p>'The wealthy and luxurious members of the Lacedemonians

decree introducing public repasts
as the means best suited to enforce
temperance.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p>'It was on this occasion that
a young man, named Alcandres,
put out one of Lycurgus's eyes
with his staff, during a popular
tumult. The people, indignant
at so great an outrage, placed the youth in his hands. Lycurgus
permitted himself a most honourable vengeance, converting him,
by his kindness, and the generosity of his treatment, from violence
and rebellion to moderation and wisdom.'&mdash;Vol. II. p. 526.

his knees; according to Plutarch, because his
right hand was longer than the left'&mdash;Vol. III.

<p>'The stories related of the
voracity of the Athletes are
almost incredible. The appetite
of Milo was barely appeased
with twenty "mines"
(or pounds) of meat, as much
bread, and three "conges" (fifteen
pints) of wine daily.
Athenes relates that Milo,
after traversing the entire length of the state&mdash;bearing
on his shoulders an ox of four years'
growth&mdash;felled the beast with one blow of his
fist, and entirely devoured it in one day.</p>

<p>'I willingly admit other exploits attributed to Milo, but is it in

in one day?'&mdash;Vol. III. p. 516.</p>

<p>'... While Darius was absent, making war in Egypt and
Arabia, the Medes revolted against him; but they were overpowered
and forced into submission. To chastise this rebellion,
their yoke, which had until that date been very easy to bear, was
made more burdensome. This fate has never been spared to
those subjects who, having revolted, are again compelled to submit
to the power they wished to depose.'&mdash;Vol. III. p. 613.

Phrygia, with Timandra, his mistress (it is pretended that Lais,
the celebrated courtesan&mdash;known as "the Corinthian"&mdash;was a
daughter of this Timandra). The ruffians who were engaged to
assassinate him had not the courage to enter his house; they
contented themselves by surrounding it and setting it on fire.
Alcibiades, sword in hand, having passed through the flames,
these barbarians did not dare to await a hand-to-hand combat
with him, but sought safety in flight; but, in their retreat, they
overcame him with showers of darts and arrows. Alcibiades fell

Like the rest of the townswomen, his mother

Thackeray's last visit to the Charterhouse&mdash;College days&mdash;Pendennis at Cambridge&mdash;Sketches

</p>

<p>In Thackeray's schooldays the Charterhouse enjoyed considerable
reputation under the head-mastership of Dr. Russell, whose death
happened in the same year as that of his illustrious pupil. No
one who has read Thackeray's novels can fail to know the kind
of life he led here. He has continually described his experiences
at this celebrated school&mdash;with the venerable archway into
Charterhouse Square, which still preserves an interesting token
of the old monkish character of the neighbourhood. Only a fortnight
before his death he was there again, as was his custom, on
the anniversary of the death of Thomas Sutton, the munificent
founder of the school. 'He was there,' says one who has
described the scene, 'in his usual back seat in the quaint old
chapel. He went thence to the oration in the Governor's room;
and as he walked up to the orator with his contribution, was
received with such hearty applause as only Carthusians can give
to one who has immortalised their school. At the banquet afterwards
he sat at the side of his old friend and artist-associate in
"Punch," John Leech; and in a humorous speech proposed, as a
toast, the noble foundation which he had adorned by his literary
fame, and made popular in his works.' 'Divine service,' says
another describer of this scene, for ever memorable as the last
appearance of Thackeray in public life, 'took place at four
o'clock, in the quaint old chapel; and the appearance of the
brethren in their black gowns, of the old stained glass and carving
in the chapel, of the tomb of Sutton, could hardly fail to give a
peculiar and interesting character to the service. Prayers were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
said by the Rev. J. J. Halcombe, the reader of the house. There
was only the usual parochial chanting of the <i>Nunc Dimittis</i>; the
familiar Commemoration-day psalms, cxxii. and c., were sung
after the third collect and before the sermon; and before the
general thanksgiving the old prayer was offered up expressive
of thankfulness to God for the bounty of Thomas Sutton, and of
hope that all who enjoy it might make a right use of it. The
sermon was preached by the Rev. Henry Earle Tweed, late Fellow
of Oriel College, Oxford, who prefaced it with the "Bidding
Prayer," in which he desired the congregation to pray generally for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
all public schools and colleges, and particularly for the welfare of
the house "founded by Thomas Sutton for the support of age
and the education of youth."'</p>

<p>From Charterhouse School Thackeray went to Trinity College,
Cambridge, about 1828, the year of his leaving the Charterhouse,
and among his fellow-students there had Mr. John Mitchell
Kemble, the great Anglo-Saxon scholar, and Mr. Tennyson.
With the latter&mdash;then unknown as a poet&mdash;he formed an acquaintance
which he maintained to the last, and no reader of
the Poet Laureate had a more earnest admiration for his productions
than his old Cambridge associate, Thackeray. At college,
Thackeray kept seven or eight terms, but took no degree; though
he was studious, and his love of classical literature is apparent in
most of his writings, either in his occasional apt two words from
Horace, or in the quaint and humorous adoption of Latin idioms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
in which, in his sportive moods, he sometimes indulged. A
recent writer tells us that his knowledge of the classics&mdash;of Horace
at least&mdash;was amply sufficient to procure him an honourable place
in the 'previous examination.'</p>

<p>To the reader who would gain an insight into Thackeray's
doings at Cambridge, we say, 'Glance through the veracious
pages in which he records the University career of Mr. Arthur
Pendennis; you will there at least seize the spirit of his own
college days, if perchance you do not find the facts of the author's
own residence circumstantially stated. Take his studies, for example.'</p>

<p>Pen's circumstances, tastes, and disposition generally, presuming
the resemblance to be merely accidental, present a tolerably
faithful reflection of those of his biographer at this period.

<p>The entire narrative occupies but scant space; and the chronicler
premises that he shall not describe his hero's academical
career very minutely. He is reticent, for he candidly declares
that this portion of a man's life does not bear telling without
certain reservations.</p>

<p>Riding, tandem-driving, and four-in-hands enjoyed in those days
the patronage more largely transferred by the present generation
to boating, cricket, billiards, &amp;c. It was probably at the University
that Thackeray began to take an interest in equestrianism: he
made numberless pictures of horses; indeed, he never hesitated
to draw them in every attitude. There is a certain rude fitness and
grotesque vigour about the animals which he sketched at the period
of life we are describing; but his skill in this respect certainly advanced
with practice, and the horses he had occasion to introduce
into his cuts when his fun was at its height&mdash;such, for example, as
the burlesque illustrations which we find scattered about the inimitable
pages of Mr. Punch&mdash;were really very original and
spirited; although perhaps they are barely the steeds which would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
be selected by timid riders, but are rather the tremendous creatures
which occur to the imagination.</p>

<p class="caption">'Ill off'</p>
</div>

<p>It is possible that Thackeray's
bill to his livery stable keeper
kept pace with his other expenses;
but his experience in this respect
was not fruitless. When he had
occasion to mix with the world,
and especially while studying
society abroad, it embittered his
judgment against the University
to realise how little return, beyond
that indefinite and somewhat
bumptious quality known as
'tone,' he had really obtained in return for the expenses of a college
career. The youth of the Continent, with whom he had the fortune
to associate for some time, made him conscious, by their own
accomplishments, of those parts of a gentleman's education which
are ignored at our Universities, and which form, it must be confessed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
the standard by which men are chiefly measured beyond
the college walls. His early papers in 'Fraser,' and especially those
supposed to be contributed by the respectable Fitz-Boodle, drawing
upon the experiences he had gained while sojourning amidst
the society of the minor German principalities, speak the truth on
these short-comings in a manner both forcible and unflinching.</p>

<p class="caption">'Just a little playful'</p>
</div>

<p>Besides his fancy for etching plates of horses and men of ultra
and parodied fashion, for designing plates of the modern rake's
progress at the Universities, and punning cuts, we may assume that
Thackeray shared with his ideal Pendennis most of those tastes
indulged by lucky youths when life is opening, and reflection does
not trouble them. Like his hero, he enjoyed a fine amateur perception
for rare editions, and had a fancy for the glories of costly
bindings: we are told that the tall copies, the gilding, marbling, and
blind-tooling put on his book-shelves were marvellous to behold.
The same just appreciation of true art which, later on, directed
Thackeray's criticisms of the picture galleries, taught Pen to despise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the tawdry and meretricious pictures of horses and opera dancers
which often captivate the judgment of fledglings, and gifted him
with a love for fine prints, for Rembrandt etchings, line-engravings
after Strange, and Wilkie's before the letter; with which he hung his
rooms, to the admiration of those who were capable of understanding
his good taste. His mind did not despise the allurements
of dress; and Pen was elaborately attired. It was a repeated
axiom of Thackeray's, that it was good for a youth at one period
to indulge in this vanity of fine apparel as a preliminary stage
to more developed ambitions of standing well with the world.</p>

<img src="images/i-078.jpg" width="235" height="161" alt="" />
<p class="caption">'Sport in earnest'</p>
</div>

<p>It will be recollected that eventually Pendennis was plucked;
and a feeling, in some degree morose, and unequivocally indignant,
seems to have taken possession of Thackeray's mind
whenever he dwells on the college careers of the creations of
his fancy. In the 'Shabby Genteel Story,' which he first gave
to the world in the columns of 'Fraser' (1840), he lashes the
system for the defects of the individuals who may have been
perverted by its more injurious influences; nor does he credit the
Universities with conferring any solid advantages. He enquires,
somewhat vengefully, the amount of ruin that has been inflicted
by the temptations to which youths are exposed in such a course of
training as is understood in England by 'the education of a gentleman.'
The 'learning to fight for oneself,' he argues, implants
an early habit of selfishness. With 'a pretty knack of Latin
hexameters, and a decent smattering of Greek plays,' the neophyte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
has learned, from his forced attendance at chapel, 'to consider the
religious service performed there as the
vainest parade in the world.' He has
learned to forget the gentle affections of
home, and, under certain conditions, to
despise his belongings. If naturally endowed
with an open hand, he has learned
to compete with associates infinitely
wealthier than himself, to despise money
on its own merits perhaps, but to respect it
as a means to the questionable advantage
of gaining admission to the company of
those whose social positions may chance
to be a source of envy to weaker minds.
In return for the two thousand pounds or
so which had been spent in acquiring 'the
tone,' he brings George Brandon&mdash;who is
certainly as black a sheep as any University
can produce&mdash;abruptly away from his
college, ruined in heart and principle;
boasting a small quantity of classics and
mathematics; with an utter contempt
for his inferiors, an enmity against his
equals; a fulsome desire to be reckoned one of those above him,
and to copy the extravagances
incident
to high position; an
easy, confident address;
sybarite habits,
utter heartlessness,
and tastes which must
be gratified without
scruple as to the
means: 'pretty compensation,'
writes the
author, 'for all he had
lost in gaining them.'</p>

<p>His pencil would
seem to have been a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
recreation of Thackeray's college days as well as of his later
career. His first efforts in etching on copper were probably produced
about the period of which we treat; the subjects of nearly
all of these plates&mdash;none of which, we believe, were ever published&mdash;were
evidently suggested by incidents in the career of an undergraduate.</p>

<p>The margins and fly-leaves of a copy of Ovid's 'Opera omnia,'
one of Black's editions of the Classics (1825), offer various whimsical
illustrations of certain portions of the poems; we incline to
the impression, however, that although some of these parodies
may be referred to Thackeray's college days, to others must be
assigned a considerably later date.</p>

<p>The earliest of Thackeray's literary efforts are associated with
Cambridge. It was in the year 1829 that he commenced, in conjunction
with a friend and fellow-student, to edit a series of
humorous papers, published in
that city, which bore the title of
'The Snob: a Literary and Scientific
Journal.' The first number
appeared on April 9 in that
year, and the publication was continued
weekly. Though affecting
to be a periodical, it was not
originally intended to publish
more than one number; but the
project was carried on for eleven
weeks, in which period Mr. Lettsom
had resigned the entire
management to his friend. The
contents of each number&mdash;which consisted only of four pages&mdash;were
scanty and slight, and were made up of squibs and
humorous sketches in verse and prose, many of which, however,
show some germs of that spirit of wild fun which afterwards distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
the 'Yellowplush Papers' in 'Fraser.' A specimen of
the contents of this curious publication cannot but be interesting
to the reader. The parody we have selected, a clever skit upon
the 'Cambridge Prize Poem,' appeared as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lines 5-10.&mdash;How skilfully introduced are the animal and vegetable productions

domestic habits of the people. The infamous manner in which they are
entrapped and sold as slaves is described, and the whole ends with an appropriate
moral sentiment. The Poem might here finish, but the spirit of the
bard penetrates the veil of futurity, and from it cuts off a bright piece for the
hitherto unfortunate Africans, as the following beautiful lines amply exemplify.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be remarked that the Author has here 'changed his hand.'
He answers that it was his intention to do so. Before, it was his endeavour
to be elegant and concise, it is now his wish to be enthusiastic and magnificent.
He trusts the Reader will perceive the aptness with which he has
changed his style; when he narrated facts he was calm, when he enters on
prophecy he is fervid.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm which he feels is beautifully expressed in lines 25 and 26.
He thinks he has very successfully imitated in the last six lines the best manner
of Mr. Pope; and in lines 12-26, the pathetic elegance of the author of
'Australasia and Athens.'</p>

<p>The Author cannot conclude without declaring that his aim in writing this
Poem will be fully accomplished if he can infuse into the breasts of Englishmen
a sense of the danger in which they lie. Yes&mdash;Africa! If he can awaken
one particle of sympathy for thy sorrows, of love for thy land, of admiration for
thy virtue, he shall sink into the grave with the proud consciousness that he
has raised esteem, where before there was contempt, and has kindled the flame
of hope on the mouldering ashes of despair!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
Early Favourites&mdash;Fielding's 'Joseph Andrews'&mdash;Imitators of Fielding&mdash;'The
Adventures of Captain Greenland'&mdash;'Jack Connor'&mdash;'Chrysal, or the Adventures
of a Guinea.'
</p>

<p>Thackeray's references to his favourite novels, and his liking,
which assumed a sort of personal regard, for the authors who
had given him pleasure, especially in youth, occur constantly
throughout his writings, both early and late.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-093.jpg" width="234" height="160" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Blind man's buff</p>
</div>

<p>He has told us how in the boyish days spent in the Charterhouse
he began to cultivate an acquaintance with the sterling
English humorists whose works had a deeply-marked influence
on his own literary training. 'Peregrine Pickle' was familiar to
him at Greyfriars; later on, Fielding's masterpieces came into his
possession. The buoyant spirit, vigorous nature, and absence of
affectation which are peculiarly the property of that great novelist,
must have highly delighted the budding author. Not only did
Thackeray treasure up 'Tom Jones' and 'Joseph Andrews,' but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
by some means he managed to get possession of various novels
now completely obsolete, the productions of less brilliant contemporaries
of Fielding, who were tempted by the success of his
frankly penned novels to attempt to reach a similar success by
walking servilely in the footsteps of the inaugurator of what may
be considered the natural order of English novel writing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-094.jpg" width="388" height="299" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Bambooz-ling</p>
</div>

<p>Of 'Joseph Andrews' he has registered his belief that novel-readers
should like this work best, and it is stated by Dr. Warton
that Fielding gave the preference to this early history above his
other writings. The hero, though but dressed in Lady Booby's
cast-off livery, Thackeray declares to be as polite as Tom Jones
in his fustian, or Captain Booth in his regimentals. 'Joseph,' in
his opinion, 'shares the elements of success with those worthies:'
he has large calves, broad shoulders, high courage, and a handsome
face; qualities apparently deemed by the novelist sure passes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
popularity, and sufficiently certain to win the hearts of the impressionable.</p>

<p>In the confidentially chatty Roundabout Essays we are favoured
with frequent introductions to the favourites of their author: no
opportunity is lost of making the reader acquainted with his friends.
Let us now turn to one of them&mdash;introducing Thackeray's graphic
illustrations.</p>

<h3>THE HISTORY OF 'JOSEPH ANDREWS.'</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-096.jpg" width="215" height="253" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The edition (1742) of
Fielding's earliest novel
which formed a portion
of Mr. Titmarsh's library
has been enriched by
certain characteristic illustrations
of the drollest
incidents.</p>

<p>But few of Thackeray's
readers can fail
to remember his sincere
appreciation of the works
of his brilliant predecessor,
Justice Fielding, the
founder of that unaffected
school of novel-writing
which has since been
rendered illustrious by many masterpieces of genius.</p>

<p>It is singularly appropriate that 'Joseph Andrews' happens to
form one of the series distinguished with Thackeray's pencillings,
as no one acquainted with his writings can fail to recall his tenderly
affectionate allusions to the author of 'Tom Jones.'</p>

<p>On the fly-leaf of 'Joseph Andrews' occurs the group of Lady
Booby tempting the Joseph of the Georgian era, which is engraved
above: the cut gives, without effort, a key to the wittiest of sly
satires; for we cannot easily forget that merry mischievous
Fielding projected this work as a ludicrous contrast to the exemplary
'Pamela,' whose literary success brought its well-meaning
prosy author so much fame, profit, and flattery. The wicked
irony of Fielding was peculiarly shocking to sensitive Richardson;
and it is certain that the persecuted Pamela appears shorn of
much of her dignity when associated with the undignified temptations
suffered by her unexceptionable brother 'Joseph.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>The substance of this novel is so generally familiar that the
merest reference will refresh the memories of our readers so
far as the incidents illustrated by these slight pencillings are
concerned.</p>

<p>Parson Adams, it may be remembered, endeavoured to raise a
loan on a volume of manuscript sermons to assist Joseph Andrews,
when Tow-mouse (the landlord), who
mistrusted the security, offered excuses.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-097.jpg" width="102" height="165" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Poor Adams was extremely dejected at
this disappointment. He immediately applied
to his pipe, his constant friend and
comfort in his afflictions; and leaning over
the rails, he devoted himself to meditation,
assisted by the inspiring fumes of tobacco.</p>

<p>He had on a night-cap drawn over his
wig, and a short great coat, which half covered
his cassock; a dress which, added to something
comical enough in his countenance, composed a figure
likely to attract the eyes of those who were not over-given to
observation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-097-copy.jpg" width="307" height="125" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Joseph Andrews and Parson Adams arrived at the inn in no
cheery plight, the hero's leg having been injured by a propensity
for performing unexpected genuflections, the pride of a horse borrowed
by the parson for the occasion. The host, a surly fellow,
treated the damaged Joseph with roughness, and Parson Adams
briskly resented the landlord's brutality by 'sending him sprawling'
on his own floor. His wife retaliated by seizing a pan of hog's-blood,
which unluckily stood on the dresser, and discharging its
contents in the good parson's face. Mrs. Slipshod entered the
kitchen at this critical moment, and attacked the hostess with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
a skill developed by practice, tearing her cap, uprooting handfuls
of hair, and delivering a succession of dexterous facers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-098.jpg" width="308" height="169" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Parson Adams, when he required a trifling loan, ventured to
wait on the swinish Parson Trulliber, whose wife introduced
Adams in error, as 'a man come for some of his hogs.' Trulliber
asserted that his animals were all pure fat, and upwards of twenty
score apiece; he then dragged the parson into his stye, which
was but two steps from his parlour-window, insisting that he
should examine them before he would speak one word with him.
Adams, whose natural complacence was beyond any artifice, was
obliged to comply before he was suffered to explain
himself, and laying hold of one of their tails, the
wanton beast gave such a sudden spring that he
threw poor Adams full length in the mire. Trulliber,
instead of assisting him to get up, burst into laughter,
and, entering the stye, said to Adams, with some
contempt, 'Why, dost not know how to handle a
hog?'</p>

</div>

<p>To those writers whose heroes are of their own
creation, and whose brains are the chaos whence all
their materials are collected&mdash;one may apply the
saying of Balzac regarding Aristotle, that they are
a second nature, for they have no communication
with the first, by which authors of an inferior
class, who cannot stand alone, are obliged to support themselves
as with crutches; but these of whom I am now speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
seem to be possessed of those stilts which the excellent Voltaire
tells us, in his letters, <i>carry the genius far off, but with an irregular
pace</i>. Indeed, far out of the sight of the reader&mdash;</p>

<p>The pedlar, introduced in these adventures, while relating to
Joseph Andrews and Parson Adams the early history of Fanny
(then returned from Lady Booby's), proceeded thus: 'Though I
am now contented with this humble way of getting my livelihood,
I was formerly a gentleman; for so all those of my profession are
called. In a word, I was drummer in an Irish regiment of foot.
Whilst I was in this honourable station, I attended an officer of our
regiment into England, a recruiting.' The pedlar then described
meeting a gipsy-woman, who confided to him, on her death-bed,
that she had kidnapped a beautiful female infant from a family
named Andrews, and sold her to Squire Booby for three guineas.
In Fanny he professed to recognise the stolen infant.

<h3>'THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN GREENLAND.'</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-100.jpg" width="225" height="237" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'The Adventures of Captain
Greenland,' an anonymous
novel published
in 1752, is avowedly
'written in imitation
of all those wise, learned,
witty, and humorous
authors who either have
or hereafter may write
in the same style and
manner.'</p>

<p>The story, divided
over a tedious number
of books&mdash;like the high-flown
romances of the
'Grand Cyrus' order&mdash;also
resembles those antiquated and unreal elaborations in the
astonishing intrepidity of its professed hero, Sylvius, who, however,
engages, like his model 'Joseph Andrews,' in situations generally
described as menial. Captain Greenland himself, denuded of his
powerful swearing propensities, might be regarded at this date as
an interesting curiosity, a British commander of the true-blue
salt type. A parson, and other characters suggestive of the acquaintances
we make in 'Joseph Andrews,' contribute to swell
the 'dramatis personæ.' A portion of the adventures, which are
neither new nor startling, consists of escapes from Spanish convents,
and complications connected with the Romanist faith, not
unlike somewhat kindred allusions in Richardson's 'Sir Charles
Grandison.'</p>

<p>A stage-coach journey occupies ten chapters of one book; and
the travellers relieve this lengthy travel (from Worcester to London)
by unfinished anecdotes. Captain Greenland relates an
adventure with a highwayman who once stopped his coach. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
'gentleman of the road' bade the driver 'unrein.' The captain
seized his blunderbuss and 'jumped ashore,' thinking it a scandal
that a gentleman who had the honour of commanding one of His
Majesty's ships of war should suffer himself to be boarded and
plundered by a single fellow. Being a little warm and hasty, he
salutes his enemy with, '"Blank my heart, but you are a blank
cowardly rascal, and a blank mean-spirited villain! You scoundrel,
you! you lurk about the course here to plunder every poor
creature you meet, that have nothing at all to defend themselves;
but you dare not engage with one that is able to encounter with
you. Here, you rascal! if you dare fight for it, win it and wear
it." With that I pulled out my purse and money, and flung it to
the ground between us; but the faint-hearted blank durst as well
be blank'd as come near me. So after I had swore myself pretty
well out of wind (judging from the captain's ordinary vernacular,
the strongest lungs could not have held out long), I ran towards
him with my cock'd blunderbuss ready in my hand; but he
at that very moment tacked about, and sheer'd off. I now
picked up my purse, and went aboard the coach; but, blank my
heart! I can't forgive myself for not saluting the rascal with one
broadside.'</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-101.jpg" width="277" height="127" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At the conclusion of ten chapters of stage-coach journeying,
the author brilliantly observes, 'He has cooped up his readers for
a considerable time,' and the captain swears the coach is somewhat
'over-manned.'</p>

<p>'At night they were all exceedingly merry and agreeable;
and the generous captain again insisted upon paying the bill himself,
which he found no matter of fault with, but in the customary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
article (at that place) of sixpence a head for firing; which he
swore was as much as could have been demanded if they had
supp'd at an inn in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.'</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-102.jpg" width="255" height="220" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-102-copy.jpg" width="278" height="206" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The next day's journey being happily concluded, without any
extraordinary occurrences, they arrived about six o'clock in the
afternoon at the 'Blue Boar Inn, in Holborn, where they all
agreed to sup together, and to lie that night.'</p>

<p>Rosetta the heroine, and her brother, Sir Christopher, attended
by the faithful Sylvius as steward, embark at Portsmouth for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Lisbon. After some thirty hours' sea-sickness, Rosetta resumed
her usual cheerfulness by making merry over her late incapacity.
'Sylvius was yet as bad as any of them. The knight (her brother)
was also in the same helpless condition, and continued in the
same manner till he was eased of the lofty tosses which were so
plentifully bestowed on them by the restless Biscaian Bay.' They
all recover at last, and are diverted by the shoals of wanton porpoises.
'By and by their remarks turned on their "little bark's
climbing so wonderfully over the vast ridges of the mountainous
waves, which formed perpetual and amazing prospects of over-rolling
hills and vales, as could scarcely meet belief from those
who had never been at sea."'</p>

<h3>'JACK CONNOR.'</h3>

<p>'Jack Connor' is another instance of the novels written by
imitators of Fielding. Aiming to produce an unaffected and easy
style of fiction, enlivened by incidents of every-day interest, it falls
far short of the standard to which it aspires, as one would reasonably
suppose. The book is anonymous, and is dedicated to
Henry Fox, 'Secretary at War,' and was published in 1752; it is
founded on a rambling plot, detailing the adventures of a 'waif'
thrown on the world by his Irish parents. The first volume is
mostly occupied by youthful 'amours,' and ends with the 'Story
Of Polly Gunn,' which unfortunately bears a certain resemblance
to De Foe's 'Moll Flanders,' in a condensed form.</p>

<p>'Jack Connor' had a patron, a marvellously proper man,
the 'model of righteous walking,' and the dispenser of admirable
precepts, over which the hero grew eminently sentimental; but
directly after acted in direct opposition to the teaching of this
worthy guardian. The pencilling we have selected from the
margin of vol. i. illustrates a passage describing the scandals of
the kitchen, which affixed to Jack Connor's benefactor, Mr. Kindly,
the questionable honour of being father to his protégé.</p>

<p>'I hope,' said Tittle, 'your la'ship won't be angry with me,
only they say that the boy is as like Mr. Kindly as two peas; but
they say, "Mem"&mdash;&mdash;'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>'Hold your impertinent tongue,' said my lady; 'is this the
occasion of so much giggle? You are an ungrateful pack. I
am sure 'tis false,' &amp;c.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-104.jpg" width="192" height="214" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Indeed,' said Tittle, 'if
I've said anything to offend
your la'ship&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, madam,' said my
lady, 'you have greatly offended
me; and so you all
have,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Tittle was not
only vastly disappointed, but
greatly frightened. She informed
the rest of the reception
she had met with. The
servants were quite surprised
at the oddity of her ladyship's
temper, and quoted many examples diametrically opposite.</p>

<p>'I'm sure,' said Mrs. Tittle, 'had I told as much to Squire
Smart's lady, we should have laughed together about it the livelong
night!'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay,' said Mrs. Matthews, 'God bless the good Lady
Malign! When I waited on her in Yorkshire, many a gown, and
petticoat, and smock have I gotten for telling her half so much;
but, to be sure, some people think themselves wiser than all the
world!'</p>

<p>'Hold, hold,' said Tom Blunt, the butler. 'Now, d'ye see, if
so be as how my lady is wrong, she'll do you right; and if so be
as how my lady is right, how like fools and ninnihammers will
you all look!'</p>

<p>In vol. ii. we find Jack Connor resorting to the reputable profession
of 'gentleman of the road;' he plans his first 'stand-and-deliver'
venture in company with two experienced highwaymen.
Hounslow is the popular spot selected for his <i>début</i>. Thither he
proceeds in a post-chaise from Piccadilly, having arranged for his
horse in advance. Two circumstances favour him; he knows a
family in the neighbourhood, and he wears a surtout of a cloth
that is blue on one side and red on the other, and that has no other
lining. In a blue coat with scarlet cuffs he orders wine, arranges for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
a return post-chaise, and enquires the address of the people whose
name he knows. He then departs, secures his horse, and turns
his coat; he is behind-hand,
and the coach just then
coming up, the two highwaymen
lead the attack:
one is shot, and the other
disabled and captured.
Connor escapes in the confusion,
ties up his horse,
turns his coat, and walks
back to the inn for his post-chaise, which is delayed, one horse
being wanting. The landlord enters. 'There, now,' said he, 'is
two fine gentlemen that have made a noble kettle of fish of it this
morning!'</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-105.jpg" width="207" height="125" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Bless me, my dear,' said his wife, 'what's the matter?'</p>

<p>'Not much; only a coach was stopped on the heath by
three highwaymen, and two of 'em is now taken, and at the next
inn.'</p>

<p>'Dear sirs,' said the landlady, ''tis the most preposteroustest
thing in life that gentlefolks won't travel in post-chaises; and then
they're always safe from these fellows.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said the husband, 'I must send after the third, who
escaped; I'll engage to find out his scarlet coat before night.'</p>

<p>Connor, recollecting his situation, chimed in with the hostess,
and spoke greatly against the disturbers of the public. At last he

<p>Jack Connor, after various vicissitudes, was at last reduced to
service, and was employed as secretary
by Sir John Curious, an infirm compound
of wealth and avarice, married, in his last
days, to a young wife. Connor became
unpopular with the ladies of the establishment,
on account of his over-correct
behaviour. One day he was busy reading
to Sir John, when Mr. Sampson, a wine merchant, entered.
The knight had a great regard for this gentleman, and was extremely
civil to him. 'Well, friend Sampson,' said he, 'time was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
when we used to meet oftener; but this plaguy gout makes me
perform a tedious quarantine, you see.'</p>

<p>'Ah, Sir John,' replied Mr. Sampson, 'you are at anchor in a
safe harbour; but I have all your ailments, and am buffeted about
in stormy winds.'</p>

<p>'Not so, not so,' answered the knight; 'I hope my old friend
is in no danger of shipwreck. No misfortunes, I hope.'</p>

<p>'None,' said Mr. Sampson, 'but what my temper can bear. I
have lost my only child, just such a youth as that (pointing to
Jack). I have lost the best part of my substance by the war, and
I have found old age and infirmities.'</p>

<p>Sir John regretted that he could not assist his friend with a
loan, but he paid his account for wine, and handed over Connor
to assist Mr. Sampson in his business.</p>

<p>After a long letter on the state of Ireland&mdash;which appeared even
in 1744 a question beyond the wisdom of legislation to dispose of
satisfactorily&mdash;the author apologises for his digressions with considerable
novelty. 'I am afraid I have carried my reader too far
from the subject-matter of this history, and tried his patience;
but I assure him that my indulgence has been very great, for,
at infinite pains, I have curtailed the last chapter (the Irish question)
at least sixty pages. Few know the difficulty of bridling the
imagination, and reining back a hard-mouthed pen. It sometimes
gets ahead, and, in spite of all our skill, runs away with us into
mire and dirt; nay, at this minute I find my quill in a humour to
gallop, so shall stop him short in time.'</p>

<p>The life of Connor is chequered. He finally figures as a captain
of dragoons in the campaign in Flanders, under the 'Culloden'
Duke. He performs deeds of valour with the army, and
rescues a Captain Thornton from three assailants, preserves his life
and secures his gratitude. He next appears at Cadiz, on a commercial
errand, and he regains his long-lost mother in Mrs. Magraph, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
wealthy widow, to whom he had made love. This lady, who had
saved thirty thousand pounds, was very communicative; she finally
recognised him as her son, and acquainted him that Sir Roger Thornton,
the life of whose son he had preserved, was in reality his father,
and not Connor, as he had previously believed. The hero then set
out for Paris. The ship was ready to sail. All were concerned at
losing so polite a companion, and he was loaded with praises and
caresses. His mother could not bear it with that resignation she
at first thought; but, however,
she raised her spirits,
and with many blessings
saw him set sail.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-107.jpg" width="215" height="153" alt="" />

<p>The voyage was prosperous,
and he arrived at
Marseilles, safe and in good
health. He took post for
Paris, and embraced his dear
friend Captain Thornton, as
indicated in the marginal
illustration. Jack Connor marries a lord's daughter, and becomes
an Irish landed gentleman. The author concludes with the regret
that he has not the materials to reveal his hero's future.</p>

<h3>'CHRYSAL, OR THE ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA.'</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-107-copy.jpg" width="141" height="188" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We gather from the copy of this work,
which was formerly on the shelves of
Thackeray's library, that 'Chrysal' had
reached seven editions in 1771, having
been originally published in 1760,
with a highly laudatory dedication to
William Pitt.</p>

<p>The bookseller's prefix to the first
edition is slightly imaginative. To describe
its nature briefly, the publisher,
while taking a country stroll in Whitechapel,
then an Arcadian village, was
overtaken by a shower, and sought shelter in a cottage where a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
humble family were breakfasting. His eye was caught by a sheet
of manuscript which had done duty for a butter-plate. Its contents
interested him, and he learnt that the chandler next door wrapped
up her commodities in such materials. He made an experimental
purchase, which was done up in another leaf of
the paper. Cautious enquiries elicited that
brown paper being costly, and a quantity of old
'stuff' having been left by a long deceased
lodger of her departed mother's, the manuscript
was thus turned into use. The enterprising
publisher invested 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for brown paper, and
secured the entire remaining sheets in exchange.
Finding, on perusal, that he had secured matter
of some literary value, he pursued his investigations
with the same lady, and learned that the author was an
unfortunate schemer, who, after wasting his entire fortune in seeking
the philosopher's stone, perceived his folly too late, wrote the story
of 'Chrysal' in ridicule of the fallacy of golden visions, and expired
before he could realise any profit by the publication of his
papers. The bookseller secretly resolved to admit the good
woman to a half share of the profits of her 'heirship,' and 'Chrysal'
appeared. It excited some attention, and had various charges
laid to its account.</p>

</div>

<p>The scheme is ingenious, tracing the guinea from its projection,
and giving an account of the successive stages of its changing
existence. We are admitted to contemplate
the influence of gold in various situations;
with dissertations on 'traffic,' and, in short,
follow the history of a guinea through the
possession of numerous owners, male and
female, while the reader is by these means introduced to
some very curious situations.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-108-copy-2.jpg" width="49" height="90" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The little design in the margin occurs in the history
of a horned cock, a parody on collectors of curiosities,
describing the manner in which a noble 'virtuoso' was
imposed upon by a cunning vendor of wonderful productions.
There was considerable competition to secure the
composite phenomenon, and when his lordship obtained it, a convocation
of 'savants' was summoned to report on the marvel. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
bird, a game-cock, had unfortunately taken offence at an owl in
a neighbouring cage, and when the company arrived it had rubbed
off one of the horns and disturbed the other. While arguing that
the bird had shed its horn in the course of nature, one of the company
dropped some snuff near the bird's eye, who thereupon shook
his head with sufficient violence to dislodge the remaining
horn; exposing the imposture, and overwhelming the virtuoso
with such vexation that the cock was sacrificed to Æsculapius
forthwith.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-109.jpg" width="126" height="92" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The guinea gets into the hands of a justice of the peace, in
the shape of a bribe, and a very remarkable state of corruption
and traffic in iniquity is displayed. The little pencilling of a
quaint figure holding the scales occurs on the margin of a paragraph
which records a warm dispute
between the justice and his clerk on
the proportioning of their plunder, the
clerk revolting against an arrangement
by which it is proposed to confine him
to a bare third! The dispute is checked
by the arrival of some customers, matrons
dwelling within the justice's district, who come to compound with
him in regular form 'for the breach of those laws he is appointed
to support.'</p>

<p>The sketches pencilled in 'Chrysal' do not follow the story
very closely; indeed, they can hardly be intimately associated
with the text they accompany. This, however, is quite an exceptional
case; the drawings found in Mr. Thackeray's books being,
in nearly every instance, very felicitous embodiments of the
subject-matter of the works they illustrate.</p>

<p>On a fly-leaf of 'Chrysal' is a jovial sketch of light-hearted
and nimble-toed tars, forming a realistic picture of the good
cheer a guinea may command, and immediately suggestive of
bags of prize-money, apoplectically stored with the yellow boys
which, in the good old days, were supposed to profusely line the
pockets of true salts when they indulged in the delights of a
spell on shore: this was the time when sailors experimented in frying,
as the story represents them, superfluous watches in bacon-fat, as a
scientific relaxation, when the ships were paid off at Portsmouth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
and 'jolly tars' had invested in more timekeepers than the exigencies
of punctuality strictly demanded.</p>

<p>We cannot take leave of Thackeray's college days without
referring to the first trip he made to Paris during a vacation, on
his own responsibility, and, indeed, without consulting his pastors
and masters on the subject. This little episode occurred when
he was nineteen years old; and, excepting for considerable remorse
at the subterfuge by which he had got away, he seems
to have enjoyed himself very much.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Thackeray seems to have repaired to Weimar,
in Saxony, where, as he describes it, he lived with a score of
young English lads, 'for study, or sport, or society.' Mr. G. H.
Lewes, in his 'Life of Goethe,' tells us that Weimar albums still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
display with pride the caricatures which the young artist sketched
at that period. 'My delight in those days,' says Mr. Thackeray,
'was to make caricatures for children'&mdash;a habit, we may add,
which he never forgot. Years afterwards, in the fulness of his fame,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
revisiting Weimar, he found, to his great delight, that these were
yet remembered, and some even preserved still; but he was much
more proud to be told, as a lad, that the great Goethe himself
had looked at some of them. In a letter to his friend Mr. Lewes,
inserted by the latter in the work referred to, Thackeray has given
a pleasing picture of this period of his life, and of the circle in
which he found himself.</p>

<p>Readers familiar with the 'Rose and the Ring,' Thackeray's
popular Christmas book, will recognise in the sketch on <a href="#Page_93">page 93</a>
the artist's fondness for playing with royalty&mdash;especially with
pantomimic royalty. The Weimar court was full of old ceremony,
and yet most pleasant and homely withal. Thackeray and his
friends were invited in turns to dinners, balls, and assemblies there.
Such young men as had a right appeared in uniforms, diplomatic
and military. Some invented gorgeous clothing: the old Hof
Marschall, M. de Spiegel, who had two of the most lovely daughters
ever looked on, being in nowise difficult as to the admission of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
these young Englanders. On winter nights they used to charter
sedan chairs, in which they were carried through the snow to these
court entertainments. Here young Thackeray had the good luck
to purchase Schiller's sword, which formed a part of his court
costume, and which hung in
his study till the day of his
death, to put him (as he said)
in mind of days of youth the
most kindly and delightful.</p>

<p>Here, too, he had the advantage of the society of his friend
and fellow-student at Cambridge, Mr. W. G. Lettsom, later Her
Majesty's Chargé-d'Affaires at Uruguay, but who was at the
period referred to attached to the suite of the English Minister at
Weimar. To the kindness of this gentleman he was indebted in a
considerable degree for the introductions he obtained to the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
families in the town. Thackeray was always fond of referring to
this period of his life.</p>

<p>The spirited sketch of a German Fencing Bout given on the

of the combat. The collegians enable us to construct a

<p>The object of the combatants being to inflict a prick or scratch
in some conspicuous part of the face, the rest of the person is
carefully padded and protected. In our days the loose cap with
its pointed peak has disappeared before its gay muffin-shaped substitute;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
but the traditional pride in a scarred face is still observable.
Even at the present day we find the youths of German
University towns rejoicing in a seam down the nose, or swaggering
in the conscious dignity of a slashed cheek, as outward and
visible evidence of the warlike soul within.</p>

versions of Shakspeare, was performing at
Weimar at that period, in 'Shylock,'
'Hamlet,' 'Falstaff,' and the 'Robbers;'
and the beautiful Madame Schröder was
appearing in 'Fidelio.'</p>

<p>The young English students at Weimar
spent their evenings in frequenting the
performances at the theatres, or attending the levées of the
Court ladies.</p>

<p>After an interval of nearly a quarter of a century, Thackeray
passed a couple of days in the well-remembered place, where he
was fortunate enough to find still some of the friends of his youth.
With his daughters he was received by Madame de Goethe with
the kindness of old days; the little party once again drank tea

<p>During his residence at Weimar in 1831 Thackeray saw and
shared a great deal of pleasant life; and although the world of the
little German capital was one in miniature, the experience he gained
in it was turned to good account in after years. It was at this
visit he had the happiness of meeting the great Goethe, who had
then withdrawn from society: he would, nevertheless, receive
strangers with marked cordiality; and the tea-table of his daughter-in-law
was always spread for the entertainment of these favoured
young sojourners.

<p>In October 1830, we find Thackeray writing from Weimar to a
bookseller in Charterhouse Square, for a liberal supply of the Bath
post paper on which he wrote his verses and drew his countless
sketches. On certain sheets of this paper, after his memorable
interview with Goethe, we find the young artist trying to trace from
recollection the features of the remarkable face which had deeply
impressed his fancy (see <a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>). There are portraits in pen and
ink, and others washed with colour to imitate more closely the complexion
of the study he was endeavouring to work out. The letter
to which we here refer contains an order of an extensive character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
for the current literature, which throws some light on his tastes at
this period:&mdash;'Fraser's <i>Town and Country Magazine</i> for August,
September, October, and November. The four last numbers of
the <i>Examiner</i> and <i>Literary Gazette</i>, <i>The Comic Annual</i>, <i>The Keepsake</i>,
and any others of the best annuals, and <i>Bombastes Furioso</i>,
with Geo. Cruikshank's illustrations. The parcel to be directed
to Dr. Frohrib, Industrie Comptoir, Weimar.'</p>

<p>Among the ingenuous confessions of Fitz-Boodle in 'Fraser,' we
are admitted to three romantic episodes, all of them being directed
as warnings to over-fervent young men&mdash;'Miss Löwe' (Oct. 1842),
'Dorothea' (Jan. 1843), 'Ottilia' (Feb. 1843): none of these tender
records of his early German experiences are reprinted with
Thackeray's 'Miscellanies.' We learn incidentally in 'Ottilia' the
delightful fee accorded to gallant drivers on the occasion of sledging
parties, which formed a leading amusement of a Saxon winter.
A large company of a score or more sledges was formed. Away
they went to some pleasure-house previously fixed upon as a
<i>rendezvous</i>, where a ball and supper were ready prepared, and
where each <i>cavalier</i>, as his partner descended, has the 'delicious
privilege of saluting her.'</p>

<p>Thackeray has turned the observations he made during his residence
in the Saxon city to famous satirical account in the construction
of his typical Court of Pumpernickel, situated on the
Pump rivulet. We meet the most effective sarcastic sketches of
the mimic court in various parts of his writings, great and small.
It was in these sister Duchies that Pitt Crawley served as an
<i>attaché</i> to the British representative. It was while dining at the table
of Tapeworm, the Secretary of our Legation there, that the author
declares he first learnt the sad particulars of the career of Mrs.
Rawdon Crawley, <i>née</i> Rebecca Sharp. It was here, too, in the theatre
that he describes first meeting with Amelia, then Mrs. Osborne,
attended by her brother Jos. Sedley, with her son George, and his
guardian, faithful Major Dobbin; when the little party were sojourning,
as favoured visitors, in the famous dominions (stretching
nearly ten miles) of his Transparency Victor Aurelius XVIII. The
reader will remember being presented, in one of the later chapters
of 'Vanity Fair,' with a humorous burlesque of the entire Grand
Ducal Court&mdash;its belongings, society, administration, foreign
legations, politics, fêtes, and what not; with a detailed description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
of the noble bridge thrown across the Pump by his renowned
Transparency Victor Aurelius XIV., whose effigy rises above the
erection; his foot calmly resting on the neck of a prostrate Turk,
and surrounded by water-nymphs and emblems of victory, peace,
and plenty. The prince is smiling blandly, and directing with his
outstretched truncheon the attention of the passer to the Aurelian
Platz, where this great-souled hero had commenced a palace that
would have been the wonder of the age, if the funds for its completion
had not been exhausted. A previous introduction to the
splendours of Kalbsbraten-Pumpernickel had been afforded the
readers of 'Fraser,' where we are informed that it contained a population
of two thousand inhabitants, and a palace (<i>Monblaïsir</i>, the
rival of Versailles) which would accommodate about six times that
number. The Principality furnished a contingent of three and a
half men to the Germanic Confederation; only three of whom returned
from the field of Waterloo. This army corps was commanded
by a General (Excellency), two major-generals, and sixty-four
officers of lower grades; all noble, all knights of the order of
Kartoffel, and almost all chamberlains to his Highness the Grand
Duke. A band of eighty performers led the troops to battle in
time of war; executed selections daily, in more peaceful intervals,
for the admiration of the neighbourhood; and at night did duty
on the stage.</p>

<p>There was supposed to be a chamber of representatives, who
were not remembered to have ever sat, home and foreign ministers,
residents from neighbouring courts, law-presidents, town councils,
&amp;c., and all the usual great government functionaries. The Court
had its chamberlains and marshals; the Grand Duchess her noble
ladies-in-waiting, and beauteous maids of honour. Besides the
sentries at the palace, there were three or four men on duty,
dressed as hussars; but the historian could not discover that they
ever rode on horseback.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister had lodgings in a second floor, and the
other great officers were similarly accommodated: their titles were,
however, a distinction in themselves&mdash;Otho Sigismond Freyherr
von Schlippenschlopps, for instance, Knight Grand Cross of the
Ducal Order of the Two Necked Swan of Pumpernickel, of the
Porc-et-Sifflet of Kalbsbraten, Commander of the George and
Blue Boar of Dummerland, Excellency and High Chancellor of
the United Duchies, is described as enjoying, with his private
income and the revenues of his offices, a total of nearly three
hundred pounds per annum, and, in consequence of this handsome
provision, being able to display such splendour as few officers of
the Grand Ducal Crown could afford.</p>

<p>The preceding sketch of sleighing, which has all the life and
spirit of a drawing executed whilst the recollection of its subject
is still fresh, was evidently made at the period of Thackeray's residence
at Weimar. He has left various pen-and-ink dottings of
the quaint houses in this town, which correspond with the little
buildings in the landscape on <a href="#Page_101">p. 101</a>.</p>

<p>Among the volumes originally in Thackeray's possession was a
book, privately printed, containing portions of the diaries of Mrs.
Colonel St. George, written during her sojourn among the German
courts, 1799 and 1800. As the margins of the book are pencilled
with slight but graphic etchings illustrative of the matter, we insert
a few extracts while treating of Thackeray's early experience of
Weimar, as harmonising with this part of our subject. It may be
premised that the actual sketches belong to a considerably later
date.</p>

<h3>'JOURNAL KEPT DURING A VISIT TO GERMANY IN
1799, 1800.'</h3>

<p>'<i>Vienna, July 18, 1800.</i>&mdash;Dined at La Gardie's; read "Les
Mères Rivales" aloud, while she made a <i>couvre-pied</i> for her approaching
confinement; her mother worked a cap for the babe,
and he sat down to his netting: it was a black shawl for his wife.
A fine tall man, a soldier, too, with a very martial appearance,
netting a shawl for his wife amused me.</p>

<p>'<i>Dresden, Oct. 2.</i>&mdash;Dined at the Elliots'.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
 While I was playing
at chess with Mr. Elliot, came the news of Lord Nelson's arrival,
with Sir William and Lady Hamilton, Mrs. Cadogan, mother of
the latter, and Miss Cornelia Knight, famous for her "Continuation
of Rasselas" and her "Private Life of the Romans."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>

<p class="caption">A fancy portrait</p>
</div>

<p>'<i>Oct. 3.</i>&mdash;Dined at Mr. Elliot's, with only the Nelson party.
It is plain that Lord Nelson thinks of nothing but Lady Hamilton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
who is totally occupied by the same object. She is bold, forward,
coarse, assuming, and vain. Her figure is colossal, but, excepting
her feet, well shaped. Her bones are large, and she is
exceedingly <i>embonpoint</i>. She resembles the bust of Ariadne: the
shape of all her features is fine, as is the form of her head, and
particularly her ears; her teeth are a little irregular, but tolerably
white; her eyes light blue, with a brown spot in one, which, though
a defect, takes nothing away from her beauty and expression. Her
eyebrows and hair are dark, and her complexion coarse. Her
expression is strongly marked, variable, and interesting; her
movements in common life ungraceful; her voice loud, yet not
disagreeable. Lord Nelson is a little man, without any dignity;
who, I suppose, must resemble what Suwarrow was in his youth,
as he is like all the pictures I have seen of that general. Lady
Hamilton takes possession of him, and he is a willing captive, the
most submissive and devoted I have seen. Sir William is old,
infirm, all admiration of his wife, and never spoke to-day but to
applaud her. Miss Cornelia Knight seems the decided flatterer
of the two, and never opens her mouth but to show forth their
praise; and Mrs. Cadogan, Lady Hamilton's mother, is what one
might expect. After dinner we had several songs in honour of
Lord Nelson, written by Miss Knight, and sung by Lady Hamilton.
She puffs the incense full in his face; but he receives it
with pleasure and sniffs it up very cordially. The songs all
ended in the sailor's way, with "Hip, hip, hip, hurra!" and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
bumper with the last drop on the nail, a ceremony I had never
heard of or seen before.</p>

<p>'<i>Oct. 4.</i>&mdash;Accompanied the Nelson party to Mr. Elliot's box at
the opera. She and Lord Nelson were wrapped up in each
other's conversation during the chief part of the evening.</p>

<p>'<i>Oct. 5.</i>&mdash;Went, by Lady Hamilton's invitation, to see Lord
Nelson dressed for court. On his hat he wore the large diamond
feather, or ensign of sovereignty, given him by the Grand Signior;
on his breast the order of the Bath, the order he received as Duke
of Bronte; the diamond star, including the sun or crescent, given
him by the Grand Signior; three gold medals, obtained by three
different victories; and a beautiful present from the King of
Naples. On one side is His Majesty's picture, richly set, and
surrounded with laurels, which spring from two united laurels
at bottom, and support the Neapolitan crown at top; on the
other is the Queen's cipher, which turns so as to appear within
the same laurels, and is formed of diamonds on green enamel.
In short, Lord Nelson was a perfect constellation of stars and
orders.</p>

<p>'<i>Oct. 7.</i>&mdash;Breakfasted with Lady Hamilton, and saw her represent
in succession the best statues and paintings extant. She
assumes their attitude, expression, and drapery with great facility,
swiftness, and accuracy. Several Indian shawls, a chair, some
antique vases, a wreath of roses, a tambourine, and a few children
are her whole apparatus. She stands at one end of the room,
with a strong light on her left, and every other window closed.
Her hair is short, dressed like an antique, and her gown a simple
calico chemise, very easy, with loose sleeves to the wrist. She
disposes the shawls so as to form Grecian, Turkish, and other
drapery, as well as a variety of turbans. Her arrangement of the
turbans is absolutely sleight-of-hand; she does it so quickly, so
easily, and so well. It is a beautiful performance, amusing to the
most ignorant, and highly interesting to the lovers of art. The
chief of her imitations are from the antique. Each representation
lasts about ten minutes. It is remarkable that, though coarse and
ungraceful in common life, she becomes highly graceful, and even
beautiful, during this performance. After showing her attitudes,
she sang, and I accompanied. Her voice is good and very
strong, but she is frequently out of tune; her expression strongly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
marked and various; but she has no flexibility, and no sweetness.
She acts her songs....</p>

<p>'Still she does not gain upon me. I think her bold, daring,
vain even to folly, and stamped with the manners of her first situation
much more strongly than one would suppose, after having
represented majesty, and lived in good company fifteen years.
Her ruling passions seem to me vanity, avarice, and love for the
pleasures of the table. Mr. Elliot says, "She will captivate the
Prince of Wales, whose mind is as vulgar as her own, and play a
great part in England."</p>

<p>'<i>Oct. 8.</i>&mdash;Dined at Madame de Loss's, wife to the Prime
Minister, with the Nelson party. The Electress will not receive
Lady Hamilton, on account of her former dissolute life. She
wished to go to court, on which a pretext was made to avoid
receiving company last Sunday, and I understand there will be no
court while she stays. Lord Nelson, understanding the Elector
did not wish to see her, said to Mr. Elliot, "Sir, if there is any
difficulty of that sort, Lady Hamilton will knock the Elector down,
and &mdash;&mdash; me, I'll knock him down too!"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-133.jpg" width="278" height="103" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'<i>Oct. 9.</i>&mdash;A great breakfast at the Elliots', given to the Nelson
party. Lady Hamilton repeated her attitudes with great effect.
All the company, except their party and myself, went away before
dinner; after which Lady Hamilton, who declared she was passionately
fond of champagne, took such a portion of it as astonished
me. Lord Nelson was not behindhand, called more
vociferously than usual for songs in his own praise, and after many
bumpers proposed the Queen of Naples, adding, "She is my
queen; she is queen to the backbone." Poor Mr. Elliot, who
was anxious the party should not expose themselves more than
they had done already, and wished to get over the last day
as well as he had done the rest, endeavoured to stop the effusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
of champagne, and effected it with some difficulty, but not till the
lord and lady, or, as he calls them, Antony and Moll Cleopatra,
were pretty far gone. I was so tired, I returned home soon after
dinner; but not till Cleopatra had talked to me a great deal of
her doubts whether the queen would receive her, adding, "I care
little about it. I had much sooner she would settle half Sir
William's pension on me." After I went, Mr. Elliot told me she
acted Nina intolerably ill, and danced the <i>Tarantula</i>. During her
acting, Lord Nelson expressed his admiration by the Irish sound
of astonished applause, and by crying every now and then, "Mrs.
Siddons be &mdash;&mdash;!" Lady Hamilton expressed great anxiety to
go to court, and Mrs. Elliot assured her it would not amuse her,
and that the Elector never gave dinners or suppers. "What?"
cried she, "no guttling!" Sir William also this evening performed
feats of activity, hopping round the room on his backbone,
his arms, legs, star and ribbon all flying about in the air.</p>

<p>'<i>Oct. 10.</i>&mdash;Mr. Elliot saw them on board to-day. He heard,
by chance, from a king's messenger, that a frigate waited for them
at Hamburg, and ventured to announce it formally. He says:
"The moment they were on board, there was an end of the fine
arts, of the attitudes, of the acting, the dancing, and the singing.
Lady Hamilton's maid began to scold, in French, about some
provisions which had been forgot. Lady Hamilton began bawling
for an Irish stew, and her old mother set about washing the
potatoes, which she did as cleverly as possible. They were
exactly like Hogarth's actresses dressing in the barn."'</p>

<p>At Berlin, the fair diarist was introduced to Beurnonville, the
French minister, who had gained notoriety for his services at
Valmy and Gemappes. He was one of the commissioners
despatched by the convention to arrest Dumouriez, who, it may
be remembered, treated him with marked cordiality; the special
envoy of the republic was, however, arrested, with his companions,
and delivered by the general into the hands of the Austrians.</p>

<p>'<i>Nov. 18-23.</i>&mdash;I have been to a great supper at Count Schulenberg's.
As usual, I saw Beurnonville, who was very attentive.
He looks like an immense cart-horse, put by mistake in the finest
caparisons; his figure is colossal and ungainly; and his uniform
of blue and gold, which appears too large even for his large
person, is half covered with the broadest gold lace. His <i>ton</i> is
that of a <i>corps-de-garde</i> (he was really a corporal), but when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
addresses himself to women, he affects a softness and <i>légèreté</i>,
which reminds one exactly of the "Ass and the Spaniel," and his
compliments are very much in the style of M. Jourdain. It
is said, however, he is benevolent and well-meaning.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-135.jpg" width="351" height="163" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'<i>Nov. 30.</i>&mdash;Supped at Mad. Angeström's,
wife of the Swedish Minister, who is perfectly
indifferent to all the interests of Europe, provided nothing interrupts
her reception of the Paris fashions, for which she has an uncommon
avidity. "<i>N'est-ce pas, ma chère, que
ceci est charmant? C'est copié fidèlement d'un
journal de Paris, et quel journal délicieux!</i>"</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-135-copy.jpg" width="98" height="295" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'She wears very little covering on her person,
and none on her arms of any kind (shifts being
long exploded), except sleeves of the finest cambric,
unlined and <i>travaillé au jour</i>, which reach
only half way from the shoulder to the elbow.
She seems to consider it a duty to shiver in
this thin attire, for she said to Lady Carysfort,
"<i>Ah, Milédi, que vous êtes heureuse, vous portez
des poches et des jupes!</i>" I conversed chiefly with
Beurnonville and Pignatelli. Beurnonville says,
"<i>Mon secrétaire est pour les affaires, mon aide-de-camp
pour les dames, et moi pour la représentation.</i>"
The people about him are conscious he
is <i>peu de chose</i>, but say, "<i>Qu'importe? on est si bon
en Prusse, et si bien disposé pour nous.</i>" A person
asked Vaudreuil, aide-de-camp to Beurnonville,
if the latter was a <i>ci-devant</i>. "<i>Non," dit-il, "mais
il voudroit l'être</i>"&mdash;a reply of a good deal of <i>finesse</i>, and plainly
proving how unconquerable the respect for rank, and wish among
those who have destroyed the substance to possess the shadow.'

</p>

<p>The Weimar reminiscences show how early Thackeray's passion
for art had developed itself. One who knew him well affirms
that he was originally intended for the Bar; but he had, indeed,
already determined to be an artist, and for a considerable period
he diligently followed his bent. He visited Rome, where he
stayed some time, and subsequently, as we shall see, settled
for some time in Paris, 'where,' says a writer in the 'Edinburgh
Review' for January 1848, 'we well remember, ten or
twelve years ago, finding him, day after day, engaged in copying
pictures in the Louvre, in order to qualify himself for his intended
profession. It may be doubted, however,' adds this writer,
'whether any degree of assiduity would have enabled him to excel
in the money-making branches, for his talent was altogether of the
Hogarth kind, and was principally remarkable in the pen-and-ink
sketches of character and situation which he dashed off for the
amusement of his friends.' This is just criticism; but Thackeray,
though caring little himself for the graces of good drawing or
correct anatomy, had a keen appreciation of the beauties of
contemporary artists. Years after&mdash;in 1848&mdash;when, as he says,
the revolutionary storm which raged in France 'drove many
peaceful artists, as well as kings, ministers, tribunes, and socialists
of state for refuge to our country,' an artist friend of his early
Paris life found his way to Thackeray's home in London. This
was Monsieur Louis Marvy, in whose <i>atelier</i> the former had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
passed many happy hours with the family of the French artist&mdash;in
that constant cheerfulness and sunshine, as his English friend
expressed it, which the Parisian was now obliged to exchange for
a dingy parlour and the fog and solitude of London. A fine and
skilful landscape-painter himself, M. Marvy, while here, as a
means of earning a living, made a series of engravings after the
works of our English landscape-painters. For some of these his
friend obtained for M. Marvy permission to take copies in the
valuable private collection of Mr. Thomas Baring. The publishers,
however, would not undertake the work without a series
of letter-press notices of each picture from Mr. Thackeray; and
the latter accordingly added some criticisms which are interesting
as developing his theory of this kind of art. The artists whose
works are engraved are Calcott, Turner, Holland, Danby, Creswick,
Collins, Redgrave, Lee, Cattermole, W. J. Müller, Harding,
Nasmyth, Wilson, E. W. Cooke, Constable, De Wint, and Gainsborough.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-137.jpg" width="262" height="263" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It was, we believe, in 1834, and while residing for a short
period in Albion Street, Hyde Park, the residence of his mother
and her second husband, Major Carmichael Smyth, that Mr.
Thackeray began his literary career as a contributor to 'Fraser's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Magazine.' The pseudonyms of 'Michael Angelo Titmarsh,'
'Fitz Boodle,' 'Yellowplush,' or 'Lancelot Wagstaff,' under which
he afterwards amused the readers of the periodicals, had not
then been thought of. His early papers related chiefly to the
Fine Arts; but most of them had some reference to his French
experiences. He seems to have had a peculiar fancy for Paris,
where he resided, with brief intervals, for some years after coming
of age, and where most of his magazine papers were written.</p>

</div>

<p>The drawing on p. 117 represents the despair (<i>désespoir</i>) of
the Orleans family at the threatened political decease (<i>décès</i>) of
Louis Philippe, familiar to Parisians as the 'Pear' (<i>Poire</i>), from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the well-known resemblance established by the caricaturists
between the shape and appearance of the king's head and a
Burgundy pear. Thackeray resided in
Paris during the contests of the king with
the caricaturists (under the banner of
Phillipon), and he was much impressed
by their wit and artistic power. If the
reader will turn to the 'Paris Sketch Book,'
he will see Mr. Thackeray's own words
upon the subject.</p>

<p>We may state, for the assistance of
the reader unacquainted with the French
caricatures of that period, that the figure
to the right with an elongated nose is M.
d'Argout; the gentleman at the foot of the bed, astride a huge
squirt (the supposed favourite implement with every French physician),
is Marshal Lobau. Queen Marie Amélie, the Duc
d'Orléans, and other members of the royal family, are in the background.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-140-copy.jpg" width="105" height="132" alt="" />
</div>

<p>One of Thackeray's literary associates has given some amusing
particulars of his Paris life, and his subsequent interest in the city,
where he had many friends and was known to a wide circle of
readers. 'He lived,' says this writer, 'in Paris "over the water,"
and it is not long since, in strolling about the Latin Quarter with
the best of companions, that we visited his lodgings, Thackeray
inquiring after those who were already forgotten&mdash;unknown. Those
who may wish to learn his early Parisian life and associations
should turn to the story of "Philip on his Way through the World."
Many incidents in that narrative are reminiscences
of his own youthful literary struggles
whilst living modestly in this city.
Latterly, fortune and fame enabled the author
of "Vanity Fair" to visit imperial Paris in
imperial style, and Mr. Thackeray put up
generally at the Hôtel de Bristol, in the
Place Vendôme. Never was increase of
fortune more gracefully worn or more generously
employed. The struggling artist and small man of letters,
whom he was sure to find at home or abroad, was pretty safe to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
be assisted if he learned their wants. I know of many a kind act.
One morning, on entering Mr. Thackeray's bedroom in Paris, I
found him placing some napoleons in a pill-box, on the lid of
which was written, "One to be taken occasionally." "What are
you doing?" said I. "Well," he replied, "there is an old person
here who says she is very ill and in distress, and I strongly suspect
that this is the sort of medicine she wants. Dr. Thackeray intends
to leave it with her himself. Let us walk out together."<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
 Thackeray
used to say that he came to Paris for a holiday and to revive
his recollections of French cooking. But he generally worked
here, especially when editing the "Cornhill Magazine."'<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>

<p class="caption">One of the ornaments of Paris</p>
</div>

<p>Thackeray's affection for Paris, however, appears to have been
founded upon no relish for the gaieties of the French metropolis,
and certainly not upon any liking for French institutions. His
papers on this subject are generally criticisms upon political,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
social, and literary failings of the French, written in a severe spirit
which savours more of the confident judgment of youth than of
the calm spirit of the citizen of the world. The reactionary rule
of Louis Philippe, the Government of July, and the boasted Charter
of 1830, were the objects of his especial dislike; nor was he less
unsparing in his views of French morals as exemplified in their law
courts, and in the novels of such writers as Madame Dudevant.
The truth is, that at this Period Paris was, in the eyes of the art-student,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
simply the Paradise of young painters. Possessed of a
good fortune&mdash;said to have amounted, on his coming of age in
1832, to 20,000<i>l.</i>&mdash;the young Englishman passed his days in the
Louvre, his evenings with his French artist acquaintances, of whom
his preface to Louis Marvy's sketches gives so pleasant a glimpse;
or sometimes in his quiet lodgings in the Quartier Latin in dashing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
off for some English or foreign paper his enthusiastic notices of the
Paris Exhibition, or a criticism on French writers, or a story of
French artist life, or an account of some great <i>cause célèbre</i> then
stirring the Parisian world. This was doubtless the happiest period
of his life. In one of these papers he describes minutely the life
of the art student in Paris, and records his impressions of it at
the time.</p>

<p class="caption">Back to the past</p>
</div>

<p>The painter's trade in France, he discovers, is a good one;
it is more appreciated, respected, and even more liberally patronised
than with us. While in England there is no school but the
'Academy' open to the young student&mdash;in those days South
Kensington did not exist, and our artists are not accustomed to
grant young beginners admission to their studios at pleasure, as has
long been the practice abroad&mdash;in France excellent schools abound,
where, under the eye of a practised master, a young man can
learn the rudiments of his art for about ten pounds a year, including
all kinds of accessory instruction, models, &amp;c.; while he
can, out of doors, obtain all sorts of incentives to study for 'just
nothing at all.'</p>

<p>The life of the young artist in France, we are told, is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
merriest, most slovenly existence possible. He comes to Paris
with some forty pounds a year settled on him to keep him and pay
all his expenses. He lives in a quarter where all his surroundings
are of the same order&mdash;art and artists; from morning till night,
he is in an atmosphere of painting; he arrives at his <i>atelier</i> very
early, and often gains a good day's study before
the doors of our Academy are unbolted.
He labours, without a sense of drudgery,
among a score of companions as merry and
poor as himself.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-145.jpg" width="92" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is certain that Thackeray had developed
a talent for writing long before he had abandoned
his intention of becoming a painter, and
that he became a contributor to magazines at
a time when there was at least no necessity for
his earning a livelihood by his pen. It is probable,
therefore, that it was his success in the
literary art, rather than his failure, as has been
assumed, in acquiring skill as a painter, which gradually drew him
into that career of authorship, the pecuniary profits of which became
afterwards more important to him.

<p>Before proceeding to the well-known productions from the pen
of our great novelist, which are familiar enough to all, it may interest
the reader to glance at his juvenile efforts in literature and
art. It will be found that we dwell more minutely upon the consideration
of these early sketches than is absolutely warranted by
their importance in comparison with his great works; but we are
tempted to enlarge on the papers which illustrate the outset of the
author's career, under the conviction that they are but little known
to the majority of his admirers.</p>

<p>We have already noticed Thackeray's characteristic hand in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
pages of 'The Snob,' where his native skill in parody was first
evidenced in print. We have incidentally cited the satirical force
of his observant powers at the age of twenty and during his residence
in Germany; though, it must be confessed, these early
impressions may owe much of their strength to the training he had
gone through during the interval between the time he actually spent
in the scenes described, and the period at which the sketches were
first given to the public.</p>

<p>From the date of its establishment the columns of 'Fraser'
abound in sly satires directed against the school of fiction which
then happened to find favour with the romance-reading public.
Ainsworth and Bulwer had made daring experiments with new and
startling materials for exciting the imagination of their believers;
and the encouragement held out by the unequivocal success of the
unwholesome order of novels was sufficient to excite the wrath of
those writers and critics who strove to lead the popular taste back
to healthier literature. Thackeray's keen appreciation of the
genuine humour of Fielding, Scott, and similar authors, who founded
the interest of their stories on such sounder principles as were
dictated by intelligent study of human nature, and who mainly
relied for their incidents on the probable occurrences, the actions
and passions, of actual life, was sufficient to qualify him as a subtle
opponent of the unnatural style; and he appears to have early enlisted
his pen on the side of the Fraserians, who were, perhaps,
the bitterest antagonists which the apostles of these unlikely
anomalies were fated to encounter in the development of their
novel theories.</p>

<p>In the August and September numbers of 'Fraser' for 1832
appeared the forerunner of those burlesque romances for which
Thackeray's name became afterwards famous. The sketch was
published when the budding satirist was little over twenty-one years
of age; and the just and scarifying criticism which it contains is
sufficiently remarkable in so youthful a writer. But there is the
strongest internal evidence that the travestie of 'Elizabeth Brownrigge:
a Tale,' proceeds from the author who afterwards narrated
the 'Story of Catharine;' who interrupted the early chapters of
'Vanity Fair' to introduce certain felicitous parodies; and who,
in the pages of 'Punch,' produced the irresistible series of 'Prize
Novelists' which remain unsurpassed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>'Elizabeth Brownrigge' was dedicated to the author of 'Eugene
Aram;' and its writer described himself as a young man who
had for a length of time applied himself to literature, but had
hitherto entirely failed to derive any emolument from his exertions.
His tragedies, comedies, operas and farces, his novels, poems, and
romances, had already accumulated into an alarming pile of unacceptable
and unprofitable MSS. On examining the grounds of
their refusal, he was surprised to find one identical phrase occurring
in every letter rejecting his talented productions: the poems are
all pronounced 'classical, pure in taste, and perfect in diction;' the
novels are acknowledged to be 'just in character, interesting in plot,
pathetic, unexceptionable in sentiment;' but unhappily they have
all one glaring defect in common&mdash;they are '<i>not of a popular description</i>.'
Enlightened by the reflection that those who write to
live must write to please, he determined to master the popular
taste; the otherwise faultless papers were put by until fashions
should change in the reading world; and his laundress was sent to
the circulating library for the last most popular novel&mdash;the author,
disappointed but not discouraged, being resolved to study its style
and manner, investigate the principles on which it was written, to
imbibe its spirit, and to compose his next new work as nearly as
possible upon the same model. The popular novel brought was
'Eugene Aram.'</p>

<p>From its pages the hitherto unsuccessful writer caught a complete
solution of the errors and defects of his former productions.
From the frequent perusal of older works of imagination, he had
learned the unfashionable practice of endeavouring so to weave the
incidents of his stories as to interest his readers in favour of virtue
and to increase their detestation of vice. By the study of 'Eugene
Aram' he was taught to mix vice and virtue up together in
such an inextricable confusion as to render it impossible that any
preference should be given to either, or that one, indeed, should
be at all distinguishable from the other.</p>

<p>'I am inclined,' continues the writer, in his dedication, 'to
regard the author of "Eugene Aram" as an original discoverer in
the world of literary enterprise, and to reverence him as the father
of a new <i>lusus naturæ</i> school.' There is no other title by which his
manner could be so aptly designated. Being in search of a tender-hearted,
generous, sentimental, high-minded hero of romance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
he turned to the 'Newgate Calendar,' and looked for him in the
list of men who have cut throats for money, among whom a
person in possession of such qualities could never have been met
with at all.</p>

<p>'In "Elizabeth Brownrigge" it will be the author's sole ambition
to impart to his efforts some portion of the intense interest
that distinguishes the works of Mr. Bulwer, and to acquire the fame
which the skilful imitation of so great a master may hope to receive
from the generosity of an enlightened and delighted public.
In taking his subject from that walk of life to which "Eugene
Aram" had directed his attention, many motives conspired to fix
the writer's choice on the heroine of the ensuing tale: she is a
classic personage&mdash;her name has been already "linked to immortal
verse" by the muse of Canning. Besides, it is extraordinary that,
as Mr. Bulwer had commenced a tragedy under the title of "Eugene
Aram," the dedicator had already sketched a burletta with the
title of "Elizabeth Brownrigge." In his dramatic piece he had
indeed been guilty of an egregious and unpardonable error: he
had attempted to excite the sympathies of his audience in favour
of the murdered apprentices; but the study of Mr. Bulwer disabused
him of so vulgar a prejudice, and, in the present version of
her case, all the interest of the reader and all the pathetic powers
of the author will be engaged on the side of the murderess. He
has taken a few slight liberties with the story, but such alterations
have the sanction of Bulwer's example and the recommendation of
his authority. As he has omitted any mention of the wife of his
Eugene, his imitator has not thought it necessary to recall the
reader's attention to the husband and sixteen children of his Elizabeth.
As the hero of "Eugene Aram" is endowed with more learning
and virtue than he possessed, and is converted from the usher
of a grammar school at Hayes into the solitary student of a lone
and romantic tower in a distant county; the author of "Elizabeth"
presumed to raise the situation of his heroine, and, instead of
portraying her as the wife of a saddler in Fleur-de-lis Court, and
midwife of the poor-house, he has represented her in his tale as a
young gentlewoman of independent fortune, a paragon of beauty, a
severe and learned moral philosopher, and the Lady Bountiful of
the village of Islington.'</p>

<p>The first book opens with a sample of the MS. Burletta: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
contents of chapter i. are sufficiently descriptive of the spirit of
the whole&mdash;<i>Islington: the Red Cabbage</i> (so called from a very imperfect
representation of a red rose on its sign-board)&mdash;<i>Specimen of
Lusus Naturæ</i>&mdash;<i>Philosophers of the Porch</i>&mdash;<i>Who is she?</i></p>

<p>According to a richly worked out principle of opposites, this
droll conception proceeds with incidents and even names taken
directly from the 'Newgate Calendar,' but rivalling 'Eugene
Aram' itself in magnificence of diction, absurdity of sentiment,
and pomp of Greek quotation. The trial scene and Elizabeth's
speech in her own defence abound in clever points&mdash;indeed, the
humour of the whole composition is original and striking; although
the later burlesques from presumably the same hand have made
us familiar with similar features brought to maturity.</p>

<p>During the intervals of his residence in London&mdash;for Paris may
be considered to have been almost his head-quarters at this period&mdash;Thackeray
had made the acquaintance of most of the brilliant
writers and rising artists of the day. It is certain that before he
became popularly known as a contributor to 'Fraser,' where his
papers contributed in no inconsiderable degree to the success of
the magazine, he was concerned in more than one literary venture.
Between 1832 and 1834 appeared a small miscellany, the 'Comic
Magazine,' now tolerably obscure: in its duodecimo pages may be
found the writings of several authors whose names have since become
famous. It was profusely illustrated: the major part of
the cuts, some of them of particular excellence, were by the hand
of the gifted and unfortunate Seymour. It seems that Thackeray
was to some extent interested in this publication, to which he
probably supplied both drawings and verses; although, at this
date, it is difficult to distinguish his individual contributions, especially
as they happen to be less characteristic than the average of
his works; the cuts, although full of fun, having suffered from the
necessity of reducing the cost of engraving, as the expenses of the
publication became onerous.</p>

<p>There existed in 1833 a critical journal, 'devoted to literature,
science, music, theatricals, and the fine arts,' rejoicing in the
slightly high-flown title of the 'National Standard:' it was one of
the early enterprises in the way of cheap publication, and, in spite
of its name, conscientiously aimed at supplying a want that has
never yet been adequately filled up&mdash;namely, the circulation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
sterling independent criticism. We are not informed how Thackeray
first became interested in this publication, but, from the hints
thrown out in his later writings, it seems that he was induced to
become, in some part, proprietor of the venture. In his sketch of
'Mr. Adolphus Simcoe,' who is introduced into the pages of
'Punch' (1842) as a typical ex-owner of a miscellany, the 'Lady's
Lute,' which came to a disastrous end, we are informed that, presuming
a person of literary tastes should, from some unfortunate
combination of circumstances, conceive a passion to become
the editor of a magazine, to assemble about him 'the great spirits
of the age,' and to be able to communicate his own contributions
direct to the public, a paper is sure to be for sale&mdash;'indeed, if a
gentleman has a mind to part with his money, it is very hard if he
cannot find some periodical with a broom at its mast-head.'</p>

<p>In the eighteenth number of the 'National Standard' (May 4)
we recognise Thackeray's pencil in a very fair cut of Louis Philippe&mdash;quite
in the style of his contributions to 'Punch' some ten
years later. The likeness is undoubtedly good and characteristic.
<i>Le roi des Français</i> is straddling in an undignified attitude&mdash;the
fair lily of France is trodden under one of his clumsy feet; he
wears an ill-fitting plain citizen suit; one hand is in his pocket,
'counting his money;' the other rests on his redoubtable umbrella,
the favourite target of satirists.</p>

<p>In his beaver he sports the tricolor badge, 'like an overgrown
pancake,' as the verses below declare. His face wears a truculent,
soured, dissatisfied twist; 'no huzzas greet his coming,' we are
informed.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'<i>He stands in París as you see him before ye,</i></p>
<p><i>Little more than</i> a snob. <i>There's an end of the story.</i>'</p>
</div></div>

<p>Number 19 of the journal opens with an address of decidedly
Titmarshian turn, which tells the story of the new state of things
pretty lucidly, and with a fine flush of spirits.</p>

<p>Under the heading of this 'National Standard' of ours there
originally appeared the following: 'Edited by F. W. N. Bayley,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Esq., the late Editor and Originator of "The National Omnibus,"
the first of the cheap Publications: assisted by the most eminent
Literary Men of the Day.'</p>

<p>'Now we have <i>changé tout cela</i>: no, not exactly <i>tout cela</i>, for we
still retain the assistance of a host of literary talent; but Frederick
William Naylor Bayley has gone. We have got free of the Old
Bailey and changed the governor. Let it not be imagined for a
moment that we talk in the slightest disparagement of our predecessor
in office; on the contrary, we shall always continue to
think him a clever fellow, and wish him all kinds of success in the
war he is carrying on against Baron Dimsdale. He apparently
has exchanged the pen for the sword.</p>

<p>'Having the fear of the fate of Sir John Cam Hobhouse before
our eyes, we give no pledges, expressed or understood, as to the
career which it is our intention to run. We intend to be as free
as the air. The world of books is all before us where to choose
our course. Others boast that they are perfectly independent of
all considerations extraneous to the sheet in which they write, but
none we know of reduce that boast to practice: we therefore
boast not at all. We promise nothing, and if our readers expect
nothing more, they will assuredly not be disappointed.'</p>

<p>A remarkably well-executed portrait of Braham, the singer,
appears in the number. The eminent vocalist's rotund figure is
dressed in stage-nautical fashion, with a tremendously striped shirt,
rolling collar, sailor's knot, no waistcoat, jacket and short trousers,
hose, and pumps with buckles; his somewhat coarse Israelitish <i>caput</i>
is hit off with truth and spirit; over his head is a glory formed of a
jew's-harp encircled in bays; he is before a theatrical background.
A dealer in old clo', of the singer's nationality, crowned with triple
hats, and carrying the professional bag, is introduced beneath
a feudal castle. Below the portrait is a sonorous parody of one
of Wordsworth's sonnets, attributing to Braham the 'majesty and
loveliness' by which he originally captivated the world and the ears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
of Sovereign Anne, in whose benign reign, according to a footnote,
this 'Lion of Judah' 'made his first appearance in England.'
The jew's-harp, circled with blooming wreath, is seen of
verdant bays; and thus are typified&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'<i>The pleasant music and the baize of green,</i></p>
<p><i>Whence issues out at eve Braham with front serene!</i>'</p>
</div></div>

<p>Certain picture criticisms in the same number bear evidence of
the hand afterwards well known in the galleries of paintings.</p>

<p>'<i>Fine Arts.</i>&mdash;<i>Somerset House Exhibition.</i>&mdash;(140) Portrait of His
Majesty King William IV. in the uniform of the Grenadier Guards,
by D. Wilkie. His Majesty stands in a dun fog, and wears a
pair of dirty boots; his cocked-hat is in his hand, and his crown
is in a corner. This large picture, in spite of the great name
attached to it, seems to us a failure; Mr. Wilkie has not at all
succeeded in the attempt to give an expression of intelligence to
the physiognomy of our reverend sovereign.'</p>

<p>In the following week this verdict is modified; it is stated that
the late critic has been dismissed as clearly incompetent for his
office. The picture, it is acknowledged, is a good work, and it
was utterly unreasonable to expect any painter could succeed in
throwing an intelligent expression into the royal countenance.</p>

<p>The writer also extravagantly praises the portrait of an alderman,
on the grounds that his address at Clapham, inscribed on a
letter held in the hand of the picture, is 'painted as natural as
though it had been written.'</p>

<p>To No. 20, Thackeray contributed a portrait of Baron Nathan
Rothschild, in which the satirist does not flatter the 'pillar of
change.' Some verses below the woodcut are not more complimentary
to 'the first Baron Juif; by the grace of his pelf, not the
King of the Jews, but the Jew of the Kings. The taste of
Plutus is censured, in that he has selected as prime favourite 'a
greasy-faced compound of donkey and pig.' After propitiating
the great financier in this fashion, the satirist leaves his subject
what he vainly wishes the Baron would leave him&mdash;'a<i>lone</i> in his
glory!'</p>

<p>In an appreciative review of Sarah Austin's translation of
Falk's 'Characteristics of Goethe' the readers of the 'National
Standard' are admitted to a glimpse of personal reminiscences:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
'The fountain opposite Goethe's house is not particularly picturesque,
and the people who frequent it are not remarkable for their
beauty. But there are beauties disclosed to the poetic eye which
the common observer will endeavour in vain to discover; and the
philosopher can make sermons on running brooks, such as the
fountain at Weimar, which, we confess, appeared to us a most
ordinary waterspout.</p>

<p>'Appended to the work is a portrait of its hero, which, however,
does not bear the slightest resemblance to him.'</p>

<p>In No. 21 occurs the first (and last) of our 'London Characters'&mdash;the
sketch of an advertising medium of Chartism; a
wretched, terror-stricken boardsman of the dispersed 'National
Convention;' bearing the legends&mdash;'No Taxes,' 'Victory or
Death,' and 'Britons, be firm!' but his placards interfere with his
escape from the police by tripping up their bearer. It is worthy of
note that this cut, with slight alterations, appeared later in the
'Comic Magazine' already mentioned.</p>

<p>In No. 22 Thackeray has produced a good <i>croquis</i> of Manager
Bunn, who is displayed with his toupee and well-brushed, heavy-jowled
mutton-cutlet whiskers, with a wig-bag seen over the shoulder
of his court coat; an elaborately embroidered satin waistcoat;
'stuck to his side a shining sword;' 'all in his velvet breeches,'
silk stockings and buckled shoes; just as, ten years later, the 'Punch'
wags were wont to picture the 'poet Alfred.' Handsome tall
candlesticks are held in either hand: these imposing dips are
sparkling with the names of Schr&oelig;der and Malibran respectively:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'<i>What gallant cavalier is seen</i></p>
<p><i>So dainty set before the queen,</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>Between a pair of candles?</i></p>
<p><i>Who looks as smiling and as bright,</i></p>
<p><i>As oily and as full of light,</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>As is the wax he handles.</i>'</p>
</div></div>

<p>Another cut&mdash;the person of a corpulent but dejected Cupid, his
fat feet resting on conventional clouds, while his chubby wrists and
ankles are confined in heavy irons&mdash;forms the headpiece to some
easy lines: a burlesque poem entitled 'Love in Fetters, a Tottenham
Court Road Ditty,' showing how dangerous it is for a
gentleman to fall in love with an 'Officer's Daughter,' an 'Ower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
True Tale.' The narrator describes his passion for a fair Israelite,
to whom he has sent a 'letter full of love;' and he is roused out
of his slumbers by a mysterious stranger, who inquires if he is the
writer. The gentleman in bed admits the fact; says the visitor,
'an answer's sent.' But alas! 'by a parchment slip he could discern
that by him stood a bailiff stern, fair Rosamunda's sire!' and
the romantic victim dolefully concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'<i>I served the daughter with verse and wit,</i></p>

</div></div>

<p>Besides the cuts mentioned is a burlesque group of chorus-singers
from 'Zauberflöte,' produced when Manager Bunn was lessee of
both Covent Garden and Drury Lane Theatres.</p>

<p>Sir Peter Laurie is also favoured with a portrait, sketched
from his appearance on the civic chair: spectacles, gold chain,
and all complete, surrounded with a wreath of full-blown laurels.
Some punning verses to 'Sir Peter' are inscribed with the likeness.</p>

<p>After this Thackeray seems to have gone back to Paris, from
whence he writes, as 'Foreign Correspondent,' in June of the same
year, sending a drawing of a brace of figures characteristic of the
new and old <i>régimes</i>.</p>

<p>'The costume of Jeune France is as extraordinary as its literature.
I have sent a specimen, which I discovered the other day
in the Tuileries. It had just been reading the "Tribune," and was
leaning poetically against a tree: it had on a red neckcloth and a
black flowing mane; a stick or club, intended for ornament as
well as use; and a pair of large though innocent spurs, which had
never injured anything except the pantaloons of the individual
who wore them. Near it was sitting an old gentleman, in knee-breeches
and a cocked-hat, who is generally to be seen of a sunny
day in the Tuileries, reading his Crébillon or his prayer-book: a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
living illustration of times past&mdash;a strange contrast with times
present!'</p>

<p>A week later arrives a review of the dramatic pieces then
performing at the Paris Theatres, with a sketch of Ligier in the
character of Richard in 'Les Enfants d'Édouard;' a wonderful
stagey figure, not unlike some of the theatrical souvenirs in the
early part of this volume. The sinister monarch wears the traditional
ermine-bound cloak, with a fierce feather in his hat; he
sports trunks (on the left knee is the order of the garter) and pointed
shoes; his right hand grasps a dagger; his lank locks are turned
over his ears, giving his face a sufficiently ruffianly character,
which is intensified by a scowling eye, and a set mouth in Kean's
best manner.</p>

<p>The young artist also paid a visit to some savages, the
'Charruas,' South American Indians, who were then lionising in
Paris. The correspondent sends his readers a translation of an
extravagant article of the flowery order, written by Jules Janin,
under the inspiration of having been to see the noble aborigines,
concerning whom the English journalist romantically adds, 'They
play cards all day, laugh, eat raw beef, and drink all they can
get.'</p>

<p>In the July following it was determined by the French ministry
to throw a sop to popularity by crowning the column in the Place
Vendôme with the new statue of Napoleon&mdash;the very figure which
has since known such vicissitudes. Their Paris correspondent
sent the 'National Standard' a sketch of the figure of the Emperor;
and in the same number occurs a spirited article, describing
the first interview of the statue with his gallant countrymen.</p>

<p>'The Little Corporal, in his habit of war, puts his bronze glass to
his bronze eye, and after some usual preliminaries, proceeds to
address <i>la grande nation</i>: "I thank you for having placed me in a
situation so safe, so commanding, and so salubrious: from this
elevation I can look on most parts of your city. I see the
churches empty, the prisons crowded, the gambling-houses overflowing.
Who, with such sights before him as these, gentlemen,
and you, would not be proud of the name of Frenchmen?" (Great
cheers.) "I apprehend that the fat man with the umbrella, whom
I see walking in the gardens of the Tuileries, is the present proprietor.
May I ask what he has done to deserve such a reward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
from you? Does he found his claim on his own merits, or on
those of his father?" (A tremendous row in the crowd; the police
proceed to <i>empoigner</i> several hundred individuals.) "Go your
ways" (said the statue, who was what is vulgarly called a dab at
an <i>impromptu</i>), "go your ways, happy Frenchmen! You have
fought, you have struggled, you have conquered: for whom? for
the fat man with the umbrella!"' The Emperor, in continuation
of his speech, observes: 'I perceive by your silence that his
words carry conviction;' when he stops to make the discovery that
there is not a single person left in the Place Vendôme, his entire
audience having been carried off by the police.</p>

<p>Later on, the journal seems to languish; the portraits still
occur at intervals. Mr. Crockford, of gaming reputation, was
flattered with a cut of his effigy, just about the time a paper-raid
was raised against the 'play-hells' in the sweeping columns of
'Fraser;' 'Crock' is complimented with some lines, 'more free than
welcome,' alluding to 'his eye of a whiting, and mouth of a cod,'
and referring to his old trade of fishmonger; the lines, which are
signed L. E. U., add, 'he now sticks to poultry, to pigeons, and
rooks.'</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'<i>Yet he still makes a cast, and not seldom a haul,</i></p>
<p class="i1"><i>Still angles for flats, and still nets what he can,</i></p>
<p><i>And shows, every night, 'mid his shoal great and small,</i></p>
<p class="i1"><i>The trick how a gudgeon is made of a man.</i>'</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is presumable that the Paris correspondent did not abandon
his paper; he sends more cuts, and foreign letters from all
parts, full of the most interesting private intelligence; and notably
one from 'Constantinople,' supplying an imaginative gossiping exposure
of all the complicated intrigues discernible to those who
may be behind the scenes at the Porte; and last, but by no means
least, he sends them one of the capital stories which he afterwards
reprinted, with fresh illustrations, in the 'Paris Sketch Book,'&mdash;even
the 'Devil's Wager,' with a strikingly original sketch of Sir
Rollo in his desperate travels to redeem his soul, borne through
the clouds with, for greater security, the tail of Mercurius unpleasantly
curled round the apoplectic throttle of his deceased highness
the late Count of Chauchigny, &amp;c. &amp;c. The moral of this veracious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
tale was promised 'in several successive numbers;' but the
wonderful story and its excellent illustration, superior we fancy to
those in the collected series, were ineffectual to establish the
success of the 'National Standard,' on which they were partially
thrown away.</p>

<p>A flourishing and facetious leader, in the thirty-sixth number,
placed the circulation at the astonishing figures of 84,715; and
particularly advertised that the price, in spite of the unprecedented
arrangements that had been perfected for rendering their paper
the leading feature of the age, would continue 'only twopence.' A
few numbers later it was confessed that the journal would henceforth
appear at threepence, as it was found impossible to successfully
carry out all their great programme of improvements at a lesser
price. Thackeray's contributions after this are either missing, or
his spirits were possibly dashed by the pecuniary responsibilities
of the undertaking. After a time the 'National Standard'
was forced to haul down its colours: it lasted from January 5,
1833, to February 1, 1834, when it not improbably left a neat
train of liabilities for at least one of its contributaries to discharge.
It is certain that its failure entailed disagreeable consequences.</p>

<p>We all remember that Mr. Adolphus Simcoe's little fortune
went down in the 'Lady's Lute,' while its versatile proprietor
completed his misery in Her Majesty's Asylum of the Fleet.</p>

<p>Still fresher must it be in the minds of Thackeray's readers,
that the narrator of 'Lovel the Widower,' in the character of Mr.
Batchelor, relates how, having these same literary aspirations, and
a certain command of ready money withal, he too was persuaded
that to be part proprietor of a periodical was rather a fine thing.
It may not be forgotten that in his first venture, coming to
London, blushing with his college experiences, he had emulated
the bargain of Moses Primrose, and the memorable gross of spectacles
in shagreen cases. A college acquaintance, with a smooth
tongue, and sleek, sanctified exterior, and a queer bill-discounter
(no one indeed but our old friends, the Rev. C. Honeyman, M.A.,
and Mr. Sherrick, wine-merchant, &amp;c., to whom we were early
introduced in the 'Newcomes'), had somehow got hold of that neat
literary paper the 'Museum,' of which eligible property this innocent
gentleman became the purchaser.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>The failure of the 'National Standard and Literary Representative'
seems for a time to have damped Thackeray's enthusiasm
so far as fresh adventures on his own account were concerned;
but in the March of 1836 his first attempt at independent
authorship appeared simultaneously in London and Paris.</p>

<p>'This publication,' it was observed in the 'North British
Review,' shortly after the humourist's death, 'at the time when
he still hoped to make his bread by art, is, like indeed everything
he either said or did, perfectly characteristic;' and it has been so
utterly forgotten that we are encouraged to describe the plates
<i>seriatim</i>. We may add that it was published in Paris by Ritter
and Goupil, and by Mitchell in London; though it is now so scarce
that we were unsuccessful in tracing a copy in the Catalogue of
the British Museum.</p>

<p>It is a small folio, in a tinted wrapper, and consists of nine
subjects in all, which are printed on India paper. Like all
Thackeray's satires, his fun is directed to a purpose; and by the
very realism of his pencil he successfully turns to ridicule one of
his pet aversions&mdash;the dancing man, so frequently assailed in his
writings.</p>

<p>The series bears the title of 'Flore et Zephyr, Ballet Mythologique,
par Théophile Wagstaff,' and is dedicated to Flora, who
herself figures in place of her name upon the cover. In a rose-bedizened
stage bower, where the foliage is evidently cut out by the
stage-carpenter, stands the exquisite <i>première danseuse</i>, looking
as ancient, self-satisfied, and repulsive as some of these heroines
occasionally appear. She is all alone in the centre of the stage,
but the old faded smirk and the eyelids modestly drooped express
her consciousness that she is the object of attraction to a full
house. Her fascinating smile is tempered with the air of bashful
modesty, conveyed by crossing her bony and sinewy arms and
large hands upon her lean chest; her throat is particularly camel-like,
and the muscles are unmistakably prominent; her nose is
long, and has a pendulous droop, which divides, by its shadow, her
ample semicircular mouth, and gives an effect of sentimental
absurdity; a blonde wreath of ample dimensions and indefinite
design surrounds her raven locks; a few straggling hairs are in
places plastered on her forehead in unpremeditated love-locks;
her dress, of simple uncreased muslin, stands out like a white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
tulip, and is carelessly girt by a wreath of flowers. Beneath the
skirts appear her professional legs, arranged of course in an attitude
perfectly at variance with nature or grace, the heels touching,
and the long white feet pointing to precisely opposite poles of the
compass. In maiden meditation, she is sighing for her Zephyr
before some thousand eyes, the focus of all the double-barrelled
lorgnettes in the theatre.</p>

<p>In the following plate, <i>La Danse fait ses offrandes sur l'autel de
l'Harmonie</i>, the faithful Zephyr has come to rejoin his Flora; and
the happy pair trip down the footlights, set smiles on their faces, with
gracious gestures of salutation, to propitiate the unseen but perfectly
understood 'house.' As to the Altar of Harmony, their backs
are turned on the supposed object of their offerings&mdash;represented
by a pile of musical instruments mounted on a pillar, and topped
by a laurel-wreathed fiddle, the expression of which ('the face of a
fiddle') wears a dreary resemblance to a dolefully-long human
countenance. Zephyr is as remarkable as his fair companion: his face
is, if possible, more faded, his smile more set and weary; you feel
that his perpetual grin is the grimmest sight in the world, and that
no effort of his livid face could express a natural smile. He too
sports a huge pair of impossibly arched eyebrows, beneath which
the heavy lids droop with a worn-out look which is certainly
unaffected. His wig, you recognise, is no part of himself, although
much of his expression is conferred by it: it is a tremendous erection,
of obviously artificial construction, and sufficiently portentous
to make its <i>début</i> alone. This gentleman's nose is large and
pear-shaped; his mouth and lips large and coarse; and his Hebrew
descent is sufficiently characterised. He is clad in a simple tunic;
his naked arms are strongly developed and ugly; his legs are
large, and the muscles stand out with the prominence observable
in members of his profession: his shoulders, of course, are tipped
with gauzy wings.</p>

<p>The third plate, <i>Jeux innocens de Zéphyr et Flore</i>, introduces
us to the altar of Cupid&mdash;a sweet little deity in plaster, who is
drawing his stringless bow, and aiming an imaginary arrow (the
shaft is wanting) at the tripping and artless Flora, who, with outstretched
hands, is guarding her tender bosom; meanwhile it is
only pantomimically she is conscious of Cupid's aims; her eyes
are riveted on the audience. Zephyr is ogling up behind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
altar, his frightful smile more set than ever, his wig more independent
of himself, his graces more fantastic; he is advancing,
with one foot pointed about a yard or so in advance of its fellow,
anxious to bind the fair sharer in these simple diversions in a
wreath of stage-flowers.</p>

<p>In the next plate <i>Flora is deploring the absence of her Zephyr</i>,
who has left her an opportunity to execute a <i>pas seul</i>. We are
presented with the back of the engaging <i>coryphée</i>: she is balanced
on one foot; the left is raised at an angle of considerably over
forty-five degrees&mdash;a touching and perfectly natural method of
expressing her disconsolate situation.</p>

<p>In this drawing we are favoured with a view of the front of the
'house;' the faces of the men in the orchestra are treated expressively.
One musician's eye is peculiarly roguish, while another
performer is endeavouring to combine business with pleasure; to
play his flageolet, follow his score, and yet not lose sight of the
deploring one.</p>

<p>Zephyr's turn for individual display occurs in the next plate.
<i>Dans un pas seul il exprime son extrême désespoir</i>; and accordingly,
without in any degree altering the cast of the mask of a face he
wears, he proceeds to express the intensity of his desolation, by
convincing the audience of the strength and activity of his lower
members, in a succession of horizontal bounds which give him the
aspect of a flying man. In the corner of the picture a Cupid&mdash;a
plump-faced little boy, decked out as Cupid&mdash;and his elder sister
(the likeness between the pair is evidently intentional) are opening
their eyes and mouths with stupid astonishment at Zephyr's grief-inspired
agility.</p>

<p>Fresh actresses arrive on the scene.</p>

<p>Zephyr has struck a stage attitude expressing the unconsolable
state of his affections; his legs crossed, and one arm resting on
the now vacant pedestal. <i>Triste et abattu, les séductions des
Nymphes le tentent en vain.</i> The ladies of the ballet flit vainly
around him, his eyes are cast down; even the fascinations which
are held out by a clumsy theatrical lyre, held in a melting <i>pose</i> by
one fair creature reposing on one knee, are insufficient to tempt
him to forget the charms of the absent.</p>

<p>Such fidelity can be only recompensed by the '<i>Reconciliation
of Flora and Zephyr</i>,' which is displayed in the succeeding plate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
The triumphant Zephyr, his smile, if possible, expressing less meaning
than usual, is now kneeling; his arms are folded, and his head
is supported at an angle by a rigid throat&mdash;for he has a weight to
sustain. The faithful Flora has bounded into his arms; and, in
the picture, the last triumphant tableau is before the audience.
One foot of the <i>danseuse</i> lightly rests on Zephyr's outstretched
thigh, the other is on a level with her shoulder; her arms are
gracefully clasped around her companion, to preserve her balance,
and her head and throat are also at a studied angle, for the sake
of the equilibrium of the group. On this rapturous scene of
fidelity rewarded with boundless happiness the curtain descends;
but we have not seen the last of the performers.</p>

<p>In, presumably, the Green Room we witness '<i>The Retreat of
Flora</i>.' The fair creature, who is in every way decidedly French,
is there with her mother and two admirers: Zephyr, of course,
does not figure in this category. The two latter pictures of the
series are in Thackeray's most forcible style; and indeed, for truth,
expressiveness, and character, compare quite favourably with
Hogarth's finer satires. One lover is a young dandy of the
period: his intellectual capacities are conspicuously absent; it
may be said he has neither forehead nor chin. He is sitting imbecilely
astride his chair, vacantly leaning his elbows on the back,
and gazing at nothing in particular; he is probably a trifle vexed at
Flora's indifference, or is jealous of his elder rival. The smiles
and leers of Flora's mamma are thrown away at present: the old
lady is no less painted, and is possibly more artificially made up
than her daughter; her eyebrows owe much to art, her cheeks are
evidently high in colour, her faded smirks and glittering eyes are
by no means inviting, and a band of velvet across her forehead
suggests a suspicion of 'false fronts;' her bonnet is of the
gaudiest, a very pinnacle of bows, ribands, and artificial flowers.
This venerable creature is heavily cloaked, and carries a huge
muff, having evidently walked to the theatre to rejoin her fair
darling, who is standing on the hearth-rug, her toes still attitudinising;
she is slightly wrapped in a shawl, ready for her <i>fiacre</i>.
The gentleman on whom Flora is smiling, and evidently at something
just a little wicked, is a big, burly, coarse, self-satisfied,
elderly man, whose hands are in the pockets of his awkward
straddling trousers: his face is a study of downright unflinching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
grinning baseness; he is probably doing a good business on the
Bourse, and his wife and family are no doubt at home in their
beds.</p>

<p>The last plate, '<i>Les Délassements de Zéphyr</i>,' is perhaps the
most refreshing to contemplate; for in it we see labour rejoicing
over those little comforts which are its reward. Poor old Zephyr,
who is after all a very homely, estimable, and hard-worked personage,
who probably gives lessons, drills the <i>ballet</i> all day, and
capers without intermission till midnight all the year round, is
resting his arm on the chimney-piece, whereon his attitude is still
a set <i>pose</i>: the preposterous wig is in the hands of the <i>perruquier</i>,
a nobly curled barber, who, as he brushes the monstrous <i>toupée</i>, is
complacently admiring what <i>he</i> evidently considers a triumph of
art. Zephyr, we can now realise, is of no particular age, or race;
he retains his jaded old sprightliness as he favours his capacious
nose with a copious pinch of snuff, supplied to that organ from
the ball of his thumb, with much apparent gratification. The
gentleman who is offering this hero the courtesy of his huge snuff-box
is a jolly, jaunty-looking person enough, a compound of splendour
and shabbiness; probably himself attached to one of the
theatres as low comedian. His jowl beams with good temper,
and is ensconced in a pair of huge gills and a voluminous neckcloth;
his hat and waistcoat are showy of their kind; his greatcoat
has evidently suffered by wear, though still an imposing and
comfortable garment. The impression of his respectability becomes
fainter below; his trousers and boots are evidently out of
shape and unequivocally seedy, and his old umbrella is a study of
itself. An innocent-faced chubby pot-boy, with a smile of recognition
for the visitor, is holding, on a tray from the nearest tavern,
a foaming pot of porter for Zephyr after his saltatory exertions,
and a glass of brandy-and-water to revive his friend, who has come
in from the cold.</p>

<p>These drawings, which are certainly equal to anything Thackeray
has produced, have been drawn on stone by Edward Morton,
son of 'Speed the Plough,' who has, if anything, contributed to
their excellence: they are remarkably well-executed examples of
lithography, and are delineated with that delicate strength, truth,
and thoughtful effect for which the works of this able but little-known
artist are always to be praised. Each plate bears the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
monogram WT, which, with the M added, afterwards became
tolerably familiar to the world.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that in this, as always, Thackeray ridicules
the ugly and the absurd without departing from truth, or
trenching on impropriety. The quality he praised highest in Cruikshank
and Leech&mdash;that of never raising a blush or offending
modesty&mdash;is perhaps most remarkable in himself, in treating a subject
like <i>Flora and Zephyr</i>, where a young artist, and especially
one whose training had been in Paris, might be tempted to imply
a certain freedom of manners. 'The effect of looking over these
<i>juvenilia</i>, these shafts from a mighty bow, is good, is moral; you
are sorry for the hard-wrought slaves; perhaps a little contemptuous
towards the idle people who go to see them.'</p>

<p>Thackeray had scarcely attained the age of three-and-twenty
when the young literary art-student in Paris was recognised as an
established contributor to 'Fraser,' worthy to take a permanent
place among the brilliant staff which then rendered this periodical
famous both in England and on the Continent. It was at that
time under the editorship of the celebrated Maginn, one of the
last of those compounds of genius and profound scholarship with
reckless extravagance and loose morals, who once flourished under
the encouragement of a tolerant public opinion. There can be no
doubt that the editor and Greek scholar who is always in difficulties,
who figures in several of his works, is a faithful picture of
this remarkable man as he appeared to his young contributor.
His friend, the late Mr. Hannay, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Certain it is that he lent&mdash;or in plainer English, gave&mdash;five
hundred pounds to poor old Maginn when he was beaten in the
battle of life, and like other beaten soldiers made a prisoner&mdash;in
the Fleet. With the generation going out&mdash;that of Lamb and
Coleridge&mdash;he had, we believe, no personal acquaintance.
Sydney Smith he met at a later time; and he remembered with
satisfaction that something which he wrote about Hood gave
pleasure to that delicate humorist and poet in his last days.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>

Thackeray's earliest literary friends were certainly found among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
brilliant band of Fraserians, of whom Thomas Carlyle, always
one of his most appreciative admirers, is probably the solitary
survivor. From reminiscences of the wilder lights in the "Fraser"
constellation were drawn the pictures of the queer fellows connected
with literature in "Pendennis"&mdash;Captain Shandon, the
ferocious Bludyer, stout old Tom Serjeant, and so forth. Magazines
in those days were more brilliant than they are now, when
they are haunted by the fear of shocking the Fogy element in
their circulation; and the effect of their greater freedom is seen
in the buoyant, riant, and unrestrained comedy of Thackeray's
own earlier "Fraser" articles. "I suppose we all begin by being
too savage," is the phrase of a letter he wrote in 1849; "<i>I know
one who did.</i>" He was alluding here to the "Yellowplush Papers"
in particular, where living men were very freely handled. This
old, wild satiric spirit it was which made him interrupt even the
early chapters of "Vanity Fair," by introducing a parody which
he could not resist of some contemporary novelist.'<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
</p>

<p>But we have a proof of the fact of how fully he was recognised
by his brother Fraserians as one of themselves, in Maclise's
picture of the contributors, prefixed to the number of 'Frasers
Magazine' for January 1835&mdash;a picture which must have been
drawn at some period in the previous year. This outline cartoon
represents a banquet at the house of the publisher, Mr.
Fraser, at which, on some of his brief visits to London, Thackeray
had doubtless been present, for it is easy to trace in the juvenile
features of the tall figure with the double eyeglass&mdash;Thackeray
was throughout life somewhat near-sighted&mdash;a portrait of the
future author of 'Vanity Fair.' Mr. Mahony, the well-known
'Father Prout' of the magazine, in his account of this picture,
written in 1859, tells us that the banquet was no fiction. In the
chair appears Dr. Maginn in the act of making a speech; and
around him are a host of contributors, including Bryan Waller
Procter (better known then as Barry Cornwall), Robert Southey,
William Harrison Ainsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, James
Hogg, John Galt, Fraser the publisher, having on his right, Crofton
Croker, Lockhart, Theodore Hook, Sir David Brewster, Thomas
Carlyle, Sir Egerton Brydges, Rev. G. R. Gleig, Mahony, Edward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Irving, and others, numbering twenty-seven in all&mdash;of whom, in
1859, eight only were living.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-166.jpg" width="334" height="237" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This celebrated cartoon of the Fraserians appears to place
Thackeray's connection with the magazine before 1835; but
we have not succeeded in tracing any contribution from his hand
earlier than November 1837. Certainly, the afterwards well-used
<i>noms de plume</i> of Michael Angelo Titmarsh, Fitzboodle, Charles
Yellowplush, and Ikey Solomons, are wanting in the earlier
volumes.</p>

<p>It is in the number for the month and year referred to that we
first find him contributing a paper which is not reprinted in his
'Miscellanies,' and which is interesting as explaining the origin of
that assumed character of a footman in which the author of the
'Yellowplush Papers' and 'Jeames's Diary' afterwards took delight.
A little volume had been published in 1837, entitled, 'My
Book; or, The Anatomy of Conduct, by John Henry Skelton.'
The writer of this absurd book had been a woollendraper in the
neighbourhood of Regent Street. He had become possessed of
the fixed idea that he was destined to become the instructor of
mankind in the true art of etiquette. He gave parties to the best
company whom he could induce to eat his dinners and assemble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
at his conversaziones, where his amiable delusion was the frequent
subject of the jokes of his friends. Skelton, however, felt them
little. He spent what fortune he had, and brought
himself to a position in which his fashionable
acquaintances no longer troubled him with their
attentions; but he did not cease to be, in his own
estimation, a model of deportment. He husbanded
his small resources, limiting himself to
a modest dinner daily at a coffee-house in the
neighbourhood of his old home, where his perfectly
fitting dress-coat&mdash;for in this article he
was still enabled to shine&mdash;his brown wig and
dyed whiskers, his ample white cravat of the
style of the Prince Regent's days, and his well-polished
boots, were long destined to raise the character of the
house on which he bestowed his patronage. In the days of his
prosperity Skelton was understood among his acquaintances to
be engaged on a work which should hand down to posterity the
true code of etiquette&mdash;that body of unwritten law which regulated
the society of the time of his favourite monarch. In the enforced
retirement of his less prosperous days, the ex-woollendraper's
literary design had time to develop itself, and in the year 1837
'My Book; or, The Anatomy of Conduct, by John Henry Skelton,'
was finally given to the world.</p>

<p>It was this little volume which fell in the way of Thackeray,
who undertook to review it for 'Fraser's Magazine.' In order to do
full justice to the work, nothing seemed more
proper than to present the reviewer in the
assumed character of a fashionable footman.
The review, therefore, took the form of a
letter from Charles Yellowplush, Esq., containing
'Fashionable fax and polite Anny-goats,'
dated from 'No. &mdash;&mdash;, Grosvenor
Square (N.B.&mdash;Hairy Bell),' and addressed
to Oliver Yorke, the well-known pseudonym
of the editor of 'Fraser.' To this accident may be attributed those
extraordinary efforts of cacography which had their germ in the
Cambridge 'Snob,' but which attained their full development in
the Miscellanies, the Ballads, the 'Jeames's Diary,' and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
short works, and also in some portions of the latest of the author's
novels. The precepts and opinions of 'Skelton,' or 'Skeleton,'
as the reviewer insisted on calling the author of the 'Anatomy,'
were fully developed and illustrated by Mr. Yellowplush. The
footman who reviewed the 'fashionable world' achieved a decided
success. Charles Yellowplush was requested by the editor to
extend his comments upon society and books, and in January
1838 the 'Yellowplush Papers' were commenced,
with those vigorous though crude
illustrations by the author, which appear
at first to have been suggested by the light-spirited
style of Maclise's portraits in the
same magazine, a manner which afterwards
became habitual to him.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p class="caption">The rejected one</p>
</div>

<p>It was in the year 1836 that Thackeray,
according to an anecdote related by himself,
offered Dickens to undertake the task
of illustrating one of his works. The story
was told by the former at an anniversary
dinner of the Royal Academy a few years
since, Dickens being present on the occasion.
'I can remember,' said Thackeray,
'when Dickens was a very young man,
and had commenced delighting the world
with some charming humorous works in
covers, which were coloured light green, and
came out once a month, that this young
man wanted an artist to illustrate his writings;
and I recollect walking up to his
chambers in Furnival's Inn, with two or
three drawings in my hand, which, strange
to say, he did not find suitable. But for the unfortunate blight
which came over my artistical existence, it would have been my
pride and my pleasure to have endeavoured one day to find a
place on these walls for one of my performances.' The work referred
to was the 'Pickwick Papers,' which was commenced in
April of that year, as the result of an agreement with Dickens
and Mr. Seymour, the comic artist&mdash;the one to write, and the
other to illustrate a book which should exhibit the adventures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
of cockney sportsmen. As our readers know, the descriptive
letterpress, by the author of the 'Sketches by Boz,' soon attracted
the attention of the world; while the clever illustrations by Seymour,
which had the merit of creating the well-known pictorial characteristics
of Mr. Pickwick and his friends, became regarded only as
illustrations of the new humorist's immortal work. Unhappily,
only two or three monthly numbers had been completed, when
Seymour destroyed himself in a fit of derangement. A new artist
was wanted, and the result was the singular interview between the
two men whose names, though representing schools of fiction so
widely different, were destined to become constantly associated in
the public mind. Dickens was then acquiring the vast popularity
as a writer of fiction which never flagged from that time: the
young artist had scarcely attempted literature, and had still before
him many years of obscurity. The slow growth of his fame presents
a curious contrast to the career of his fellow-novelist. Hard
as Thackeray subsequently worked in contributing to 'Fraser,'
in co-operating with others on daily newspapers, in writing for
'Cruikshank's Comic Almanack,' for the 'Times' and the 'Examiner,'
for 'Punch,' and for the 'Westminster' and other
Reviews, it could not be said that he was really known to the
public till the publication of 'Vanity Fair,' when he had been an
active literary man for at least ten years, and had attained the age
of thirty-seven. The 'Yellowplush Papers' in 'Fraser' enjoyed a
sort of popularity, and were at least widely quoted in the newspapers;
but of their author few inquired. Neither did the two
volumes of the 'Paris Sketch Book,' though presenting many good
specimens of his peculiar humour, nor the account of the second
funeral of Napoleon, nor even the 'Irish Sketch Book,' do much
to make their writer known. It was his 'Vanity Fair' which,
issued in shilling monthly parts, took the world of readers as it
were by storm; and an appreciative article from the hand of a
friend in the 'Edinburgh Review,' in 1848, for the first time
helped to spread the tidings of a new master of fiction among us,
destined to make a name second to none, in its own field.</p>

<p>Thackeray was in Paris in March 1836, at the time of the
execution of Fieschi and Lacénaire, upon which subject he wrote
some remarks in one of his anonymous papers which it is interesting
to compare with the more advanced views in favour of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
abolition of the punishment of death, which are familiar to the
readers of his subsequent article, 'On Going to see a Man Hanged.'
He did not witness the execution either
of Fieschi or Lacénaire, though he made
unsuccessful attempts to be present at
both events.</p>

<p>The day for Fieschi's death was purposely
kept secret; and he was executed
at a remote quarter of the town. But
the scene on the morning when his execution
did not take place was never
forgotten by the young English artist.</p>

<p>It was carnival time, and the rumour
had pretty generally been carried abroad
that the culprit was to die on that day.
A friend who accompanied Thackeray
came many miles through the mud and
dark, in order to be 'in at the death.'
They set out before light, floundering
through the muddy Champs Elysées,
where were many others bent upon the
same errand. They passed by the
Concert of Musard, then held in the
Rue St. Honoré; and round this, in the wet, a number of coaches
were collected: the ball was just up; and a crowd of people,
in hideous masquerade, drunk, tired, dirty, dressed in horrible
old frippery and daubed with filthy rouge, were trooping out of
the place; tipsy women and men, shrieking, jabbering, gesticulating,
as Frenchmen will do; parties swaggering, staggering forwards,
arm in arm, reeling to and fro across the street, and yelling
songs in chorus. Hundreds of these were bound for the show,
and the two friends thought themselves lucky in finding a vehicle
to the execution place, at the Barrière d'Enfer. As they crossed
the river, and entered the Rue d'Enfer, crowds of students, black
workmen, and more drunken devils from carnival balls, were
filling it; and on the grand place there were thousands of these
assembled, looking out for Fieschi and his <i>cortége</i>. They waited,
but no throat-cutting that morning; no august spectacle of satisfied
justice; and the eager spectators were obliged to return, disappointed
of the expected breakfast of blood.</p>

</div>

<p>The other attempt was equally unfortunate. The same friend
accompanied him, but they arrived too late on the ground to be
present at the execution of Lacénaire and his co-mate in murder,
Avril. But as they came to the spot (a gloomy round space,
within the barrier&mdash;three roads led to it&mdash;and, outside, they saw
the wine-shops and restaurateurs of the barrier looking gay and
inviting), they only found, in the midst of it, a little pool of ice,
just partially tinged with red. Two or three idle street boys were
dancing and stamping about this pool; and when the Englishmen
asked one of them whether the execution had taken place, he
began dancing more madly than ever, and shrieked out with a
loud fantastical theatrical voice, '<i>Venez tous, Messieurs et Dames;
voyez ici le sang du monstre Lacénaire et de son compagnon le
traître Avril</i>;' and straightway all the other gamins screamed out
the words in chorus, and took hands and danced round the little
puddle.</p>

<p>Thackeray returned to London in March 1836, and resided
for a few months in the house of his step-father, Major Henry
Carmichael Smyth. The principal object of his return was to
concert with the Major, who was a gentleman of some literary
attainments, a project for starting a daily newspaper. The time
was believed to be remarkably opportune for the new journal; the
old oppressive newspaper stamp being about to be repealed, and
a penny stamp, giving the privilege of a free transmission through
the post, to be substituted. Their project was to form a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
joint-stock company, to be called the Metropolitan Newspaper
Company, with a capital of 60,000<i>l.</i>, in shares of 10<i>l.</i> each. The
Major, as chief proprietor, became chairman of the new company;
Laman Blanchard was appointed editor, Douglas Jerrold the dramatic
critic, and Thackeray the Paris correspondent. An old and
respectable, though decaying journal, entitled the 'Public Ledger,'
was purchased by the company; and on September 15, the first
day of the reduced stamp duty, the newspaper was started with
the title of the 'Constitutional and Public Ledger.' The politics
of the paper were ultra-liberal. Its programme was entire freedom
of the press, extension of popular suffrage, vote by ballot, shortening
of duration of parliaments, equality of civil rights and religious
liberty. A number of the most eminent of the advanced
party, including Mr. Grote, Sir William Molesworth, Mr. Joseph
Hume, and Colonel Thompson, publicly advertised their intention
to support the new journal, and to promote its circulation.
Thackeray's Paris letters, signed 'T. T.,' commenced on September
24, and were continued at intervals until the spring of the
following year. They present little worth notice. At that time
the chatty correspondent who discourses upon all things save the
subject of his letter was a thing unknown. Bare facts, such as
the telegraph-wire now brings us, with here and there a <i>soupçon</i> of
philosophical reflection, were the utmost that the readers of newspapers
in those days demanded of the useful individual who kept
watch in the capital of civilisation for events of interest. Generally,
however, the letters are characterised by a strong distaste for
the Government of July, and by an ardent liberalism which had
but slightly cooled down when, at the Oxford election in 1857, he
declared himself an uncompromising advocate of vote by ballot.
Writing from Paris on October 8, he says: 'We are luckily too
strong to dread much from open hostility, or to be bullied back
into Toryism by our neighbours; but if Radicalism be a sin in
their eyes, it exists, thank God! not merely across the Alps, but
across the Channel.' The new journal, however, was far from
prosperous. After enlarging its size and raising its price from
fourpence-halfpenny to fivepence, it gradually declined in circulation.
The last number appeared on July 1, 1837, bearing black
borders for the death of the king. 'We can estimate, therefore,'
says the dying speech of the 'Constitutional,' 'the feelings of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
gentleman who once walked at his own funeral,' and the editor, or
perhaps his late Paris correspondent, adds: 'The adverse circumstances
have been various. In the philosophy of ill-luck it may
be laid down as a principle that every point of discouragement
tends to one common centre of defeat. When the Fates do concur
in one discomfiture their unanimity is wonderful. So has it happened
in the case of the "Constitutional." In the first place, a
delay of some months, consequent upon the postponement of the
newspaper stamp reduction, operated on the minds of many who
were originally parties to the enterprise; in the next, the majority
of those who remained faithful were wholly inexperienced in the
art and mystery of the practical working of an important daily
journal; in the third, and consequent upon the other two, there
was the want of those abundant means, and of that wise application
of resources, without which no efficient organ of the interests
of any class of men&mdash;to say nothing of the interests of that first
and greatest class whose welfare has been our dearest aim and
most constant object&mdash;can be successfully established. Then
came further misgivings on the part of friends, and the delusive
undertakings of friends in disguise.' The venture proved in every
way a disastrous one. Although nominally supported by a joint-stock
company, the burden of the undertaking really rested upon
the original promoters, of whom Major Smyth was the principal,
while his step-son, Thackeray, also lost nearly all that remained of
his fortune.</p>

<p>It was shortly after the failure of the 'Constitutional' that
Thackeray married in Paris a Miss Shaw, sister of the Captain
Shaw, an Indian officer, who was one of the mourners at his
funeral, an Irish lady of good family, who bore him two daughters,
the elder of whom first gave, during her illustrious father's life-time,
indications of inheriting his talents, in the remarkable story of 'Elizabeth,'
written by her, and published in the 'Cornhill Magazine.' In
1837 he left Paris with his family, and resided for two years in Great
Coram Street, London, when he began to devote himself seriously
to literary labour, adding, we believe, occasional work as an illustrator.
We are told that he contributed some papers to the
'Times' during the late Mr. Barnes's editorship&mdash;an article on
'Fielding' among them. He is believed to have been connected
with two literary papers of his time&mdash;the 'Torch,' edited by Felix
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Fax, Esq., and the 'Parthenon,' which must not be confounded
with a literary journal with the same name recently existing. The
'Torch,' which was started on August 26, 1837, ran only for six
months, and was immediately succeeded by the 'Parthenon,' which
had a longer existence. In neither paper, however, is it possible
to trace any sign of that shrewd criticism and that overflowing
humour which distinguish the papers in 'Fraser.' For the latter
publication he laboured assiduously, and it was at this time that
the 'Yellowplush Papers' appeared, with occasional notices of the
Exhibitions of Paintings in London. Among his writings of this
period (1837-1840) we also find 'Stubbs's Calendar, or the Fatal
Boots,' contributed to his friend Cruikshank's 'Comic Almanack'
for 1839, and since included in the 'Miscellanies;' 'Catherine, by
Ikey Solomons, jun.,' a long continuous story, founded on the
crime of Catherine Hayes, the celebrated murderess of the last
century, and intended to ridicule the novels of the school of Jack
Sheppard, and illustrated with outline cartoons by the author;
'Cartouche' and 'Poinsonnet,' two stories, and 'Epistles to the
Literati.' In 1839 he visited Paris again, at the request of the
proprietor of 'Fraser,' in order to write an account of the French
Exhibition of Paintings, which appeared in the December
number.</p>

<p>On his return he devoted himself to writing the 'Shabby
Genteel Story,' which was begun in 'Fraser' for June, and continued
in the numbers for July, August, and October, when it
stopped unfinished at the ninth chapter. The story of this strange
failure is a mournful one. While busily engaged in working out this
affecting story, a dark shadow descended upon his household,
making all the associations of that time painful to him for ever.
The terrible truth, long suspected, that the chosen partner of his
good and evil fortunes could never participate in the success for
which he had toiled, became confirmed. The mental disease
which had attacked his wife rapidly developed itself, until the
hopes which had sustained those to whom she was most dear
were wholly extinguished. Thackeray was not one of those who
love to parade their domestic sorrows before the world. No explanation
of his omission to complete his story was given to his
readers; but, years afterwards, in reprinting it in his 'Miscellanies,'
he hinted at the circumstances which had paralyzed his hand, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
rendered him incapable of ever resuming the thread of his story,
with a touching suggestiveness for those who knew the facts. The
tale was interrupted, he said, 'at a sad period of the writer's own
life.' When the republication of the 'Miscellanies' was announced,
it was his intention to complete the little story&mdash;but the colours
were long since dry, the artist's hand had changed. It 'was
best,' he said, 'to leave the sketch as it was when first designed
seventeen years ago. The memory of the past is renewed as he
looks at it.'<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
</p>

<p>It was in 1840 that Thackeray contributed to the 'Westminster'
a kindly and appreciative article upon the productions
of his friend George Cruikshank, illustrated&mdash;an unusual thing for
the great organ of the philosophers of the school of Bentham, J.
Mill, and Sir W. Molesworth&mdash;with numerous specimens of the
comic sketches of the subject of the paper. His defence of
Cruikshank from the cavils of those who loved to dwell upon his
defects as a draughtsman is full of sound criticism, and his claim
for his friend as something far greater, a man endowed with that
rarest of all faculties, the power to create, is inspired by a generous
enthusiasm which lends a life and spirit to the paper not often
found in a critical review. This long paper, signed with the Greek
letter Theta, is little known, but Thackeray frequently referred to
it as a labour in which he had felt a peculiar pleasure.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1840 Thackeray collected some of his original
sketches inserted in 'Fraser' and other periodicals, English and
foreign, and republished them under the title of the 'Paris Sketch
Book.' This work is interesting as the first independent publication
of the author, but of its contents few things are now remembered.
The dedicatory letter prefixed, however, is peculiarly characteristic
of the writer. It relates to a circumstance which had occurred to
him some time previously in Paris. The old days when money
was abundant, and loitering among the pictures of the Paris galleries
could be indulged in without remorse, had gone. The <i>res angusta
domi</i> with which genius has so often been disturbed in its
day-dreams began to be familiar to him. The unfortunate failure
of the 'Constitutional'&mdash;a loss which he, years afterwards, occasionally
referred to as a foolish commercial speculation on which
he had ventured in his youth&mdash;had absorbed the whole of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
patrimony. At such a time a temporary difficulty in meeting a
creditor's demand was not uncommon. On one such occasion, a
M. Aretz, a tailor in the Rue Richelieu, who had for some time
supplied him with coats and trousers, presented him with a
small account for those articles, and was met with a statement
from his debtor that an immediate settlement of the bill would be
extremely inconvenient to him. To Titmarsh's astonishment the
reply of his creditor was, 'Mon Dieu, sir, let not that annoy you.
If you want money, as a gentleman often does in a strange country,
I have a thousand-franc note at my house which is quite at your
service.' The generous offer was accepted. The coin which, in
proof of the tailor's esteem for his customer, was advanced without
any interest, was duly repaid together with the account; but the
circumstance could not be forgotten. The person obliged felt
how becoming it was to acknowledge and praise virtue, as he slily
said, wherever he might find it, and to point it out for the admiration
and example of his fellow-men. Accordingly, he determined
to dedicate his first book to the generous tailor, giving at full
length his name and address. In the dedicatory letter, he accordingly
alludes to this anecdote, adding&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>'History or experience, sir, makes us acquainted with so few
actions that can be compared to yours; a kindness like yours,
from a stranger and a tailor, seems to me so astonishing, that you
must pardon me for thus making your virtue public, and acquainting
the English nation with your merit and your name. Let me
add, sir, that you live on the first floor; that your clothes and fit
are excellent, and your charges moderate and just; and, as a
humble tribute of my admiration, permit me to lay these volumes
at your feet.</p>

<p>A second edition of the 'Paris Sketch Book' was announced
by the publisher, Macrone&mdash;the same publisher who had a few
years before given to the world the 'Sketches by Boz,' the first of
Dickens' publications; but the second edition was probably only
one of those conventional fictions with which the spirits of young
authors are sustained. Though containing many flashes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Titmarsh humour, many eloquent passages, and much interesting
reading of a light kind, the public took but a passing interest in
it. Years after, in quoting its title, the author good-humouredly
remarked, in a parenthesis, that some copies, he believed, might
still be found unsold at the publisher's; but the book was forgotten
and most of its contents were rejected by the writer when
preparing his selected miscellanies for the press. A similar couple
of volumes, published by Cunningham in 1841, under the title of
'Comic Tales and Sketches, edited and illustrated by Mr. Michael
Angelo Titmarsh,' and an independent republication, also in two
volumes, of the 'Yellowplush Papers,' from 'Fraser,' were somewhat
more successful. The former contained 'Major Gahagan'
and the 'Bedford-row Conspiracy,' reprinted from the 'New
Monthly;' 'Stubbs's Calendar, or the Fatal Boots,' from Cruikshank's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
'Comic Almanack;' some amusing criticisms on the 'Sea
Captain,' and 'Lady Charlotte Bury's Diary,' and other papers
from 'Fraser.' The illustrations to the volumes were tinted etchings
of a somewhat more careful character than those unfinished
artistic drolleries in which he generally indulged. A brace of
portraits of Dr. Lardner and Bulwer may be reckoned in the great
humourist's happiest caricature vein.</p>

<p>In December 1840 he again visited Paris, and remained there
until the summer of the following year. He was in that city on
the memorable occasion of the second funeral of Napoleon, or the
ceremony of conveying the remains of that great warrior, of whom,
as a child, he had obtained a living glimpse, to their last resting-place
at the Hôtel des Invalides. An account of that ceremony, in
the form of a letter to Miss Smith, was published by Macrone. It
was a small square pamphlet, chiefly memorable now as containing
at the end his remarkable poem of the 'Chronicle of the Drum.'
About this time he advertised, as preparing for immediate publication,
a book entitled 'Dinner Reminiscences, or the Young Gourmandiser's
Guide at Paris, by Mr. M. A. Titmarsh.' It was to be
issued by Hugh Cunningham, the publisher, of St. Martin's Place,
Trafalgar Square, but we believe was never published.</p>

<p>It was in the September number of 'Fraser,' for 1841, that he
commenced his story of the 'History of Samuel Titmarsh, and the
Great Hoggarty Diamond,' which, though it failed to achieve
an extraordinary popularity, first convinced that select few who
judge for themselves in matters of literature and art, of the great
power and promise of the unknown 'Titmarsh.' Carlyle, in his
'Life of John Sterling,' quotes the following remarkable passage
from a letter of the latter to his mother, written at this period:&mdash;'I
have seen no new books, but am reading your last. I got hold
of the two first numbers of the "Hoggarty Diamond," and read
them with extreme delight. What is there better in Fielding or
Goldsmith? The man is a true genius, and with quiet and comfort
might produce masterpieces that would last as long as any we have,
and delight millions of unborn readers. There is more truth and
nature in one of these papers than in all &mdash;&mdash;'s novels put together.'
'Thackeray (adds Carlyle), always a close friend of the Sterling
House, will observe that this is dated 1841, not 1851, and will
have his own reflections on the matter.' The 'Hoggarty Diamond'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
was continued in the numbers for October and November, and
completed in December 1841. In the number for June of the
following year, 'Fitzboodle's Confessions' were commenced, and
were continued at intervals down to the end of 1843. The 'Irish
Sketch Book,' in two volumes, detailing an Irish tour, was also
published in the latter year. The 'Sketch Book' did not at the
time attract much attention. The 'Luck of Barry Lyndon,' by
many considered the most original of his writings, was begun and
finished at No. 88, St. James Street, previously known as the Conservative
Club, where at this time he occupied chambers. The first
part appeared in 'Fraser' for January 1844, and was continued
regularly every month, till its completion in the December number.
He was engaged a short time before this as assistant editor of the
'Examiner' newspaper, to which journal he contributed numerous
articles; and among his papers in 'Fraser' and other magazines
of the same period, we find, 'Memorials of Gourmandising;' 'Pictorial
Rhapsodies on the Exhibitions of Paintings;' 'Bluebeard's
Ghost;' a satirical article on Grant's 'Paris and the Parisians;' a
'Review of a Box of Novels' (already quoted from); 'Little
Travels and Roadside Sketches' (chiefly in Belgium); 'The
<i>Partie Fine</i>, by Lancelot Wagstaff'&mdash;a comic story, with a sequel
entitled 'Arabella, or the Moral of the <i>Partie Fine</i>;' 'Carmen
Lilliense;' 'Picture Gossip;' more comic sketches, with the titles
of 'The Chest of Cigars, by Lancelot Wagstaff;' 'Bob Robinson's
First Love;' and 'Barmecide Banquets,' and an admirable satirical
review entitled 'A Gossip about Christmas Books.'</p>

<p>The 'Carmen Lilliense' will be well remembered by the
readers of the 'Miscellanies,' published in 1857, in which it was
included. Thackeray was in the north of France and in Belgium
about the period when it is dated (2nd September, 1843);
and the ballad describes a real accident which befell him, though
doubtless somewhat heightened in effect. It tells how, leaving
Paris with only twenty pounds in his pocket, for a trip in Belgium,
he arrived at Antwerp, where, feeling for his purse, he found it had
vanished with the entire amount of his little treasure. Some
rascal on the road had picked his pocket, and nothing was left but
to borrow ten guineas of a friend whom he met, and to write a
note to England addressed to 'Grandmamma,' for whom we may
probably read some other member of the Titmarsh family. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
ten guineas, however, were soon gone, and the sensitive Titmarsh
found himself in a position of great delicacy. What was to be
done? 'To stealing,' says the ballad, 'he could never come.'
To pawn his watch he felt himself 'too genteel;' besides, he had
left his watch at home, which at once put an end to any debates
on this point. There was nothing to do but to wait for the remittance,
and beguile the time with a poetical description of his woes.
The guests around him ask for their bills. Titmarsh is in agonies.
The landlord regards him as a 'Lord Anglais,' serves him with the
best of meat and drink, and is proud of his patronage. A sense of
being a kind of impostor weighs upon him. The landlord's eye
became painful to look at. Opposite is a dismal building&mdash;the
prison-house of Lille, where, by a summary process, familiar to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
French law, foreigners who run in debt without the means of paying
may be lodged. He is almost tempted to go into the old Flemish
church and invoke the saints there after the fashion of the country.
One of their pictures on the walls becomes, in his imagination,
like the picture of 'Grandmamma,' with a smile upon its countenance.
Delightful dream! and one of good omen. He returns
to his hotel, and there to his relief finds the long-expected letter,
in the well-known hand, addressed to 'Mr. M. A. Titmarsh,
Lille.' He obtains the means of redeeming his credit, bids farewell
to his host without any exposure, takes the diligence, and is
restored to his home that evening. Such are the humorous exaggerations
with which he depicts his temporary troubles at Lille, in
the shape of a ballad, originally intended, we believe, for the
amusement of his family, but finally inserted in 'Fraser.'</p>

<p>It was in July 1844 that Thackeray started on a tour in the
East&mdash;the result of a hasty invitation, and of a present of a free
pass from a friend connected with the Peninsular and Oriental
Steam Navigation Company. His sudden departure, upon less
than thirty-six hours' notice, is pleasantly detailed in the preface to
his book, published at Christmas, 1845, with the title of 'Notes of
a Journey from Cornhill to Grand Cairo by way of Lisbon, Athens,
Constantinople, and Jerusalem: performed in the steamers of the
Peninsular and Oriental Company. By M. A. Titmarsh, author of
the "Irish Sketch Book," &amp;c.'</p>

<p>The book was illustrated with coloured drawings by the author,
treating, in a not exaggerated vein of fun, the peculiarities of the
daily life of the East. The little book was well received, and in
the reviews of it there is evidence of the growing interest of the
public in the writer. For the first time it presented him to his
readers in his true name, for though the 'Titmarsh' fiction is preserved
on the title-page, the prefatory matter is signed 'W. M.
Thackeray.'</p>

<p>'"Who is Titmarsh?" says one of his critics at this time.
Such is the ejaculatory formula in which public curiosity gives vent
to its ignorant impatience of pseudonymous renown. "Who is
Michael Angelo Titmarsh?" Such is the note of interrogation
which has been heard at intervals these several seasons back,
among groups of elderly loungers in that row of clubs, Pall Mall;
from fairy lips, as the light wheels whirled along the row called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
"Rotten;" and oft amid keen-eyed men in that grandfather of
rows which the children of literature call Paternoster....</p>

<p>'This problem has been variously and conflictingly solved, as
in the parallel case of the grim old <i>stat nominis umbra</i>. There is
a hint in both instances of some mysterious connection with the
remote regions of Bengal, and an erect old pigtail of the E.I.C.S.
boasts in the "horizontal" jungle off Hanover Square, of having
had the dubious advantage of his personal acquaintanceship in
Upper India, where his I O U's were signed
Major Goliah Gahagan; and several specimens
of that documentary character, in good
preservation, he offers at a low figure to
amateurs.'</p>

<p>The foundation in 1841 of a weekly periodical,
serving as a vehicle for the circulation
of the lighter papers of humourists,
had unquestionably an important influence
in the development of his talents and fame.
From an early date he was connected with
'Punch,' at first as the 'Fat Contributor,'
and soon after as the author of 'Jeames's
Diary' and the 'Snob Papers.' If satire
could do aught to check the pride of the
vulgar upstart, or shame social hypocrisy into
truth and simplicity, these writings would
accomplish the task. In fact, Thackeray's name was now becoming
known, and people began to distinguish and enquire for
his contributions; his illustrations in 'Punch' being as funny as
his articles were. The series called 'Jeames's Diary' caused
great amusement and no little flutter in high polite circles, for the
deposition from the throne of railwaydom of the famous original
of 'Jeames de la Pluche' had hardly then begun, though it was
probably accelerated by the universal titters of recognition which
welcomed the weekly accounts of the changing fortunes of
'Jeames.'

<p>The great work, however, which was to stamp the name of
Thackeray for ever in the minds of English readers was yet to
come. Hitherto all his writings had been brief and desultory, but
in contributing to magazines his style had gradually matured itself.
That ease of expression, and that repose which seems so full of
power, were never more exemplified than in some of his latest
essays in 'Fraser,' before book writing had absorbed all his time.
His articles on Sir E. B. Lytton's 'Memoir of Laman Blanchard,'
his paper on 'Illustrated Children's Books,' his satirical proposal
to Mons. Alexandre Dumas for a continuation of 'Ivanhoe,' all
contributed to 'Fraser' in 1846, and his article&mdash;we believe the
last which he wrote for that periodical&mdash;entitled 'A Grumble
about Christmas Books,' published in January 1847, are equal to
anything in his later works. The first-mentioned of these papers,
indeed&mdash;the remonstrance with Laman Blanchard's biographer&mdash;is
unsurpassed for the eloquence of its defence of the calling of
men of letters, and for the tenderness and manly simplicity with
which it touches on the history of the unfortunate subject of the
memoir.

<p>'Mrs. Perkins's Ball,' a Christmas book, was published in
December 1846. But its author had long been preparing for a
more serious undertaking. Some time before, he had sketched
some chapters entitled 'Pencil Sketches of English Society,' which
he had offered to Colburn for insertion in the 'New Monthly
Magazine.' It formed a portion of a continuous story, of a
length not yet determined, and was rejected by Colburn after
consideration. The papers which Thackeray had previously
contributed to the 'New Monthly' were chiefly slight comic
stories&mdash;perhaps the least favourable specimens of his powers.
They were, indeed, not superior to the common run of magazine
papers, and were certainly not equal to his contributions to
'Fraser.' In fact, as a contributor to the 'New Monthly' he
had achieved no remarkable success, and his papers appear to
have been little in demand there. Whether the manuscript had
been offered to 'Fraser'&mdash;the magazine in which 'Titmarsh' had
secured popularity, and where he was certainly more at home&mdash;we
cannot say. Happily, the author of 'Pencil Sketches of English
Society,' though suspending his projected work, did not abandon
it. He saw in its opening chapters&mdash;certainly not the best portions
of the story when completed&mdash;the foundations of a work
which was to secure him at last a fame among contemporary
writers in his own proper name. The success of Dickens's shilling
monthly parts suggested to him to make it the commencement
of a substantive work of fiction, to be published month by
month, with illustrations by the author. The work grew up by
degrees, and finally took shape under the better title of 'Vanity
Fair.' It was during this time, the latter part of 1846, that he
removed to his house at No. 13 Young Street, Kensington, a
favourite locality with him, in which house he resided for some
years. He also at this time occupied chambers at No. 10 Crown-office
Row, Temple, the comfortable retirement which, 'up four
pair of stairs,' with its grand view, when the sun was shining, of
the chimney-pots over the way, he has himself described. His
friend Tom Taylor, the well-known dramatist and biographer,
had chambers in the same house; and we believe, on the demolition
of No. 10 Crown-office Row, wrote a poem, published in the
pages of 'Punch,' in which, if we remember rightly, mention is
made of the fact of Thackeray's having resided there. Thackeray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
was called to the bar by the Honourable Society of the Middle
Temple in 1848, though he never practised, and probably never
intended to do so. The Benchers, however, were not insensible
to the addition to the numerous literary associations with their
venerable and quiet retreat which they thus gained. After his
death there was some proposition to bury him in the Temple, of
which he was a member, amid (as Spenser says)&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>There Goldsmith is buried, and Thackeray's ashes would have
been fitly laid near those of the author of the 'Vicar of Wakefield,'
whose brilliant genius he so heartily eulogised, and whose many
shortcomings he so tenderly touched upon, in the 'Lectures on
the Humourists.' But, after consultation with his relations, it was
deemed better that he should rest with his own family in Kensal
Green. Pending this decision, the sanction of the Benchers to
interment within the precincts of the Temple Church had been
asked and cheerfully accorded; and when the Kensal Green
Cemetery was finally decided upon, the Benchers were requested
to permit the erection of a memorial slab in their church. Their
reply to this was, that not only should they be honoured by such
a memento, but that, if allowed, they would have it erected at
their own cost.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>

<p>The first monthly portion of 'Vanity Fair' was published on
February 1, 1847, in the yellow wrapper which served to distinguish
it from Charles Dickens's stories, and
which afterwards became the standard
colour for the covers of Thackeray's
serial stories. The work was continued
monthly, and finished with the number
for July of the following year. Thackeray's
friends, and all those who had
watched his career with special interest,
saw in it at once a work of greater promise than any that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
appeared since the dawn of his great contemporary's fame; but
the critical journals received it somewhat coldly. There were
indeed few tokens of its future success in the tone of its reception
at this early period.</p>

<p>It is generally acknowledged that to the thoughtful and appreciative
article in the 'Edinburgh Review' of January 1848, which
dealt with the first eleven numbers of the work only, is due the
merit of authoritatively calling attention
to the great power it displayed.
The writer was evidently one who
knew Thackeray well; for he gives
a sketch of his life, and mentions
having met him some years before,
painting in the Louvre in Paris. 'In
forming,' says this judicious critic,
'our general estimate of this writer,
we wish to be understood as referring
principally, if not exclusively, to
"Vanity Fair" (a novel in monthly
parts), which, though still unfinished,
is immeasurably superior, in our
opinion, to every other known production
of his pen. The great charm
of this work is its entire freedom
from mannerism and affectation both
in style and sentiment&mdash;confiding frankness with which the
reader is addressed&mdash;the thoroughbred carelessness with which
the author permits the thoughts and feelings suggested by the
situations to flow in their natural channel, as if conscious that
nothing mean or unworthy, nothing requiring to be shaded, gilded,
or dressed up in company attire, could fall from him. In a word,
the book is the work of a gentleman, which is one great merit,
and not the work of a fine (or would-be fine) gentleman, which is
another. Then, again, he never exhausts, elaborates, or insists
too much upon anything; he drops his finest remarks and happiest
illustrations as Buckingham dropped his pearls, and leaves
them to be picked up and appreciated as chance may bring a discriminating
observer to the spot. His effects are uniformly the
effects of sound, wholesome, legitimate art; and we need hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
add, that we are never harrowed up with physical horrors of the
Eugène Sue school in his writings, or that there are no melodramatic
villains to be found in them. One touch of nature makes
the whole world kin, and here are touches of nature by the dozen.
His pathos (though not so deep as Dickens's) is exquisite; the
more so, perhaps, because he seems to struggle against it, and to
be half ashamed of being caught in the melting mood; but the
attempt to be caustic, satirical, ironical, or philosophical, on such
occasions, is uniformly vain; and again and again have we found
reason to admire how an originally fine and kind nature remains
essentially free from worldliness, and, in the highest pride of intellect,
pays homage to the heart.'</p>

<p>It was at this time, his friend Hannay tells us, that he first
had the pleasure of seeing him. '"Vanity Fair,"' he adds, 'was
then unfinished, but its success was made; and he spoke frankly
and genially of his work and his career. "Vanity Fair" always,
we think, ranked in his own mind as best in story of his greater
books; and he once pointed out to us the very house in Russell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Square where his imaginary Sedleys lived&mdash;a curious proof of the
reality his creations had for his mind.' The same writer tells us
that when he congratulated Thackeray, many years ago, on the
touch in 'Vanity Fair' in which Becky admires her husband when
he is giving Lord Steyne the chastisement which ruins <i>her</i> for life,
the author answered with that fervour as well as heartiness of
frankness which distinguished him: 'Well, when I wrote the sentence,
I slapped my fist on the table, and said, "That is a touch
of genius!"' 'Vanity Fair' soon rose rapidly in public favour, and
a new work from the pen of its author was eagerly looked for.</p>

<p class="caption">Sensitive to a point</p>
</div>

<p>During the time of publication of 'Vanity Fair' he had found
time to write and publish the little Christmas book entitled 'Our
Street,' which appeared in December 1847, and reached a second
edition soon after Christmas. 'Vanity Fair' was followed in 1849
by another long work of fiction, entitled the 'History of Pendennis;
his Fortunes and Misfortunes, his Friends and his Greatest
Enemy; with Illustrations by the Author;' which was completed
in two volumes. In this year, too, he published 'Dr. Birch' and
'Rebecca and Rowena.' It was during the publication of 'Pendennis'
that a criticism in the 'Morning Chronicle' and in the
'Examiner' newspapers drew from him a remarkable letter on the
'Dignity of Literature,' addressed to the editor of the former
journal.</p>

<p>It was a peculiarity of Thackeray to feel annoyed at adverse
criticism, and to show his annoyance in a way which more cautious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
men generally abstain from. He did not conceal his feeling
when an unjust attack was levelled at him in an influential journal.
He was not one of those remonstrators who never see anything
in the papers, but have their attention called to them by friends.
If he had seen, he frankly avowed that he had seen the attack, and
did not scruple to reply if he had an opportunity, and the influence
of the journal or reviewer made it worth while. With the 'Times'
he had had very early a bout of this kind. When the little account
of the funeral of Napoleon in 1840 was published, the 'Times,' as
he said, rated him, and talked in 'its own great roaring way about
the flippancy and conceit of Titmarsh,' to which he had replied by
a sharp paragraph or two. In 1850 a very elaborate attack in the
chief journal roused his satirical humour more completely. The
article which contained the offence was on the subject of his
Christmas book, entitled the 'Kickleburys on the Rhine,' published
in December 1850, upon which a criticism appeared in that
journal, beginning with the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption">Over-weighted</p>
</div>

<p>'It has been customary, of late years, for the purveyors of
amusing literature&mdash;the popular authors of the day&mdash;to put forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
certain opuscles, denominated "Christmas Books," with the ostensible
intention of swelling the tide of exhilaration, or other expansive
emotions, incident upon the exodus of the old and the
inauguration of the new year. We have said that their ostensible
intention was such, because there is another motive for these productions,
locked up (as the popular author deems) in his own breast,
but which betrays itself, in the quality of the work, as his principal
incentive. Oh! that any muse should be set upon a high stool
to cast up accounts and balance a ledger! Yet so it is; and
the popular author finds it convenient to fill up the declared deficit
and place himself in a position the more effectually to encounter
those liabilities which sternly assert themselves contemporaneously
and in contrast with the careless and free-handed tendencies of the
season by the emission of Christmas books&mdash;a kind of literary
<i>assignats</i>, representing to the emitter expunged debts, to the
receiver an investment of enigmatical value. For the most part
bearing the stamp of their origin in the vacuity of the writer's
exchequer rather than in the fulness of his genius, they suggest by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
their feeble flavour the rinsings of a void brain after the more
important concoctions of the expired year. Indeed, we should as
little think of taking these compositions as examples of the merits
of their authors as we should think of measuring the valuable
services of Mr. Walker the postman, or Mr. Bell the dust-collector,
by the copy of verses they leave at our doors as a provocative
of the expected annual gratuity&mdash;effusions with which they may
fairly be classed for their intrinsic worth no less than their ultimate
purport.'</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-191.jpg" width="210" height="295" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Too much for his horse</p>
</div>

<p>Upon this, and upon some little peculiarities of style in the
review, such as a passage in which the learned critic compared the
author's satirical attempts to 'the sardonic divings after the pearl
of truth whose lustre is eclipsed in the display of the diseased
oyster,' Thackeray replied in the preface to a second edition
of the little book, published a few days later, and entitled an
'Essay on Thunder and Small Beer.' The style of the 'Times'
critique, which was generally attributed to Samuel Phillips,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
afforded too tempting a subject for the satirical pen of the author
of 'Vanity Fair,' to be passed over. The easy humour with
which he exposes the pompous affectation of superiority in his
critic, the tawdry sentences and droll logic of his censor, whom
he likened not to the awful thunderer of Printing House Square,
but to the thunderer's man, 'Jupiter Jeames, trying to dazzle and
roar like his awful employer,' afforded the town, through the
newspapers which copied the essay, an amount of amusement
not often derived from an author's defence of himself from adverse
criticism.</p>

<p>The essay was remembered long after, when work after work of
the offending author was severely handled in the same paper; and
the recollection of it gave a shadow of support to the theory
by which some persons, on the occasion of Thackeray's death,
endeavoured to explain the fact that the obituary notice in the
'Times,' and the account of his funeral, were more curt than those
of any other journal; while the 'Times' alone, of all the daily
papers, omitted to insert a leading article on the subject of the
great loss which had been sustained by the world of letters.

</p>

<p>In 1851 Thackeray appeared in an entirely new character, but
one which subsequently proved so lucrative to him, that to
this cause, even more than to the labours of his pen, must be attributed
that easy fortune which he had accumulated before he died.
In May he commenced the delivery of a series of lectures on the
English Humourists. The subjects were&mdash;Swift, Congreve and
Addison; Steele; Prior, Gay and Pope; Hogarth, Smollett and
Fielding, and Sterne and Goldsmith. The lectures were delivered
at Willis's Rooms. The price of admission was high, and the
audience was numerous, and of the most select kind. It was
not composed of that sort of people who crowd to pick up information
in the shape of facts with which they have been previously
unacquainted, but those who, knowing the eminence of
the lecturer, wished to hear his opinion on a subject of national
interest. One of the two great humourists of the present age was
about to utter his sentiments on the humourists of the age now
terminated, and the occasion was sufficient to create an interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
which not even the attractive power of the Great Exhibition, then
open, could check. The newspapers complained slightly of the low
key in which the lecturer spoke, from which cause many of his best
points were sometimes lost to the more distant of his auditors.
'In other respects,' says a newspaper report, 'we cannot too highly
praise the style of his delivery.' Abstaining from rant and gesticulation
he relied for his effect on the matter which he uttered, and
it was singular to see how the isolated pictures by a few magic
touches descended into the hearts of his hearers. Among the
most conspicuous of the literary ladies at this gathering was Miss
Brontë, the authoress of 'Jane Eyre.' She had never before seen
the author of 'Vanity Fair,' though she had dedicated the second
edition of her own celebrated novel to him, with the assurance
that she regarded him 'as the social regenerator of his day&mdash;as the
very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude
the warped state of things.' Mrs. Gaskell tells us that, when the
lecture was over, the lecturer descended from the platform, and
making his way towards her, frankly asked her for her opinion.
'This,' adds Miss Brontë's biographer, 'she mentioned to me not
many days afterwards, adding remarks almost identical with those
which I subsequently read in "Villette," where a similar action on
the part of M. Paul Emanuel is related.' The remarks of this
singular woman upon Thackeray and his writings, and her accounts
of her interviews with him, are curious, and will be found
scattered through Mrs. Gaskell's popular biography. Readers of
the 'Cornhill Magazine' will not have forgotten Thackeray's affectionate
and discriminating sketch of her, which appeared some
years later in that periodical.</p>

<p>The course was perfectly successful, and the Lectures, subsequently
reprinted, rank among the most masterly of his writings.
They were delivered again soon afterwards in some of the provincial
cities, including Edinburgh. A droll anecdote was related
at this period in the newspapers, in connection with one of these
provincial appearances. Previously to delivering them in Scotland,
the lecturer bethought himself of addressing them to the rising
youth of our two great nurseries of the national mind; and it was
necessary, before appearing at Oxford, to obtain the licence of the
authorities&mdash;a very laudable arrangement, of course. The Duke of
Wellington was the Chancellor, who, if applied to, would doubtless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
have understood at once the man and his business. The Duke
lived in the broad atmosphere of the every-day world, and a copy
of 'Vanity Fair' was on a snug shelf at Walmer Castle. But his
deputy at Oxford, on whom the modest applicant waited, knew
less about such trifles as 'Vanity Fair' and 'Pendennis.' 'Pray
what can I do to serve you, sir?' enquired the bland functionary.
'My name is Thackeray.' 'So I see by this card.' 'I seek permission
to lecture within the precincts.' 'Ah! you are a lecturer;
what subjects do you undertake&mdash;religious or political?' 'Neither;
I am a literary man.' 'Have you written anything?'
'Yes; I am the author of "Vanity Fair."' 'I presume a dissenter&mdash;has
that anything to do with John Bunyan's book?'
'Not exactly; I have also written "Pendennis."' 'Never heard
of these works; but no doubt they are proper books.' 'I have
also contributed to "Punch."' '"Punch!" I have heard of
<i>that</i>; is it not a ribald publication?'</p>

<p>An invitation to deliver the lectures in America speedily followed.
The public interest which heralded his coming in the
United States was such as could hardly have been expected for a
writer of fiction who had won his fame by so little appeal to the
love of exciting scenes. His visit (as an American critic remarked
at the time) at least demonstrated that if they were unwilling to
pay English authors for their books, they were ready to reward
them handsomely for the opportunity of seeing and hearing them.</p>

<p>At first the public feeling on the other side of the Atlantic had
been very much divided as to his probable reception. 'He'll
come and humbug us, eat our dinners, pocket our money, and go
home and abuse us, like Dickens,' said Jonathan, chafing with the
remembrance of that grand ball at the Park Theatre, and the Boz
tableaux, and the universal speaking and dining, to which the
author of 'Pickwick' was subject while he was their guest. 'Let
him have his say,' said others, 'and we will have our look. We
will pay a dollar to hear him, if we can see him at the same time;
and as for the abuse, why it takes even more than two such cubs
of the roaring British lion to frighten the American eagle. Let
him come, and give him fair play.' He did come, and certainly
had fair play; and as certainly there was no disappointment with
his lectures. Those who knew his books found the author in the
lecturer. Those who did not know the books, says one enthusiastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
critic, 'were charmed in the lecturer by what is charming in
the author&mdash;the unaffected humanity,
the tenderness, the sweetness, the genial
play of fancy, and the sad touch of truth,
with that glancing stroke of satire which,
lightning-like, illumines while it withers.'
He did not visit the West, nor Canada.
He went home without seeing Niagara
Falls. But wherever he did go, he found
a generous social welcome, and a respectful
and sympathetic hearing. He
came to fulfil no mission; but it was
felt that his visit had knit more closely
the sympathy of the Americans with
Englishmen. Heralded by various romantic
memoirs, he smiled at them,
stoutly asserted that he had been always
able to command a good dinner, and to
pay for it, nor did he seek to disguise
that he hoped his American tour would
help him to command and pay for more.
He promised not to write a book about
the Americans, and he kept his word.</p>

<p>His first lecture was delivered to a crowded audience: on
November 19 he commenced his lectures before the Mercantile
Library Association, in the spacious
New York church belonging to the
congregation presided over by the
Rev. Dr. Chapin.</p>

<p>Before many days the publishers
told the world that the subject of
Thackeray's talk had given rise to
a Swift and Congreve and Addison
furore. The booksellers were
driving a thrifty trade in forgotten
volumes of 'Old English Essayists;'
the 'Spectator' found its way again
to the parlour tables; old Sir Roger
de Coverley was waked up from his long sleep. 'Tristram
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Shandy' even was almost forgiven his lewdness, and the Ass
of Melun and Poor Le Fevre were studied wistfully, and placed
on the library table between 'Gulliver' and the 'Rake's Progress.'
Girls were working Maria's pet lamb upon their samplers, and
hundreds of Lilliput literary ladies were twitching the mammoth
Gulliver's whiskers.</p>

<p>The newspaper gossipers were no less busy in noting every
personal characteristic of the author. One remarks: 'As for the
man himself who has lectured us, he is a stout, healthful, broad-shouldered
specimen of a man, with cropped greyish hair, and
keenish grey eyes, peering very sharply through a pair of spectacles
that have a very satiric focus. He seems to stand strongly
on his own feet, as if he would not be easily blown about or upset,
either by praise or pugilists; a man of good digestion, who takes
the world easy, and scents all shams and humours (straightening
them between his thumb and forefinger) as he would a pinch
of snuff.' A London letter of the time says: 'The New York
journalists preserve, on the whole, a delicate silence (very creditable
to them) on the subject of Mr. Thackeray's
nose; but they are eloquent about his
legs; and when the last mail left a controversy
was raging among them on this matter,
one party maintaining that "he stands very
firm on his legs," while the opposition asserted
that his legs were decidedly "shaky."'</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-197.jpg" width="111" height="269" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These, however, were light matters compared
with the notices in other newspapers,
which unscrupulously raked together, for the
amusement of their readers, details which
were mostly untrue, and where true, were of
too private a character for public discussion.
This led to a humorous remonstrance, forwarded
by Thackeray to 'Fraser's Magazine,'
where it appeared with the signature
of 'John Small.' In this he gave a droll
parody of his newspaper biographers' style,
which caused some resentment on the part of the writers
attacked. One Transatlantic defender of the New York
press said that 'the two most personal accounts of Thackeray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
published appeared in one of the Liverpool papers, and in
the London "Spectator;"' adding, 'the London correspondents
of some of the provincial papers spare nothing of fact or comment
touching the private life of public characters. Nay, are there not
journals expressly devoted to the contemporary biography of
titled, wealthy, and consequential personages, which will tell you
how, and in what company, they eat, drink, and travel; their
itinerary from the country to London, and from the metropolis to
the Continent; the probable marriages, alliances, &amp;c.? No
journal can be better acquainted with these conditions of English
society than the classical and vivacious "Fraser." Why, then,
does John Small address that London editor from New York,
converting some paltry and innocent-enough penny-a-liner notice
of the author of "Vanity Fair" into an enormous national sin and
delinquency?' Among the lectures delivered at New York, before
he quitted the gay circles of the 'Empire City' for Boston, was
one in behalf of a charity; and the charity lecture was stated to
be a <i>mélange</i> of all the others, closing very appropriately with an
animated tribute to the various literary, social, and humane
qualities of Charles Dickens. 'Papa,' he described his daughter
as exclaiming, with childish candour; 'papa, I like Mr. Dickens's
book much better than yours.'</p>

<p>The remonstrance of John Small in 'Fraser,' however, did not
conclude without a warm acknowledgment of the general kindness
he had received in America, thus feelingly expressed in his last
lecture of the series, delivered on April 7. 'In England,' he said,
'it was my custom, after the delivery of these lectures, to point
such a moral as seemed to befit the country I lived in, and to protest
against an outcry which some brother authors of mine most
imprudently and unjustly raise, when they say that our profession
is neglected and its professors held in light esteem. Speaking in
this country, I would say that such a complaint could not only not
be advanced, but could not even be understood here, where your
men of letters take their manly share in public life; whence
Everett goes as minister to Washington, and Irving and Bancroft
to represent the Republic in the old country. And if to English
authors the English public is, as I believe, kind and just in the
main, can any of us say, will any who visit your country not
proudly and gratefully own, with what a cordial and generous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
greeting you receive us? I look around on this great company.
I think of my gallant young patrons of the Mercantile Library
Association, as whose servant I appear before you, and of the
kind hand stretched out to welcome me by men famous in letters,
and honoured in our own country as in their own, and I thank
you and them for a most kindly greeting and a most generous
hospitality. At home and amongst his own people it scarce
becomes an English writer to speak of himself; his public estimation
must depend on his works; his private esteem on his character
and his life. But here, among friends newly found, I ask
leave to say that I am thankful; and I think with a grateful heart
of those I leave behind me at home, who will be proud of the
welcome you hold out to me, and will benefit, please God, when
my days of work are over, by the kindness which you show to
their father.'</p>

<p>A still more interesting paper was his Preface to Messrs.
Appleton and Co.'s New York edition of his minor works.
Readers will remember Thackeray's droll account, in one of
his lectures, of his first interview with the agent of Appleton and
Co., when holding on, sea-sick, to the bulwarks of the New York
steam-vessel on his outward voyage. The preface referred to
contains evidence that the appeal of the energetic representative
of that well-known publishing house was not altogether fruitless.
It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>'On coming into this country I found that the projectors of
this series of little books had preceded my arrival by publishing
a number of early works, which have appeared under various
pseudonyms during the last fifteen years. I was not the master to
choose what stories of mine should appear or not; these miscellanies
were all advertised, or in course of publication; nor have I
had the good fortune to be able to draw a pen, or alter a blunder
of author or printer, except in the case of the accompanying
volumes which contain contributions to "Punch," whence I have
been enabled to make something like a selection. In the
"Letters of Mr. Brown," and the succeeding short essays and
descriptive pieces, something graver and less burlesque was
attempted than in other pieces which I here publish. My friend,
the "Fat Contributor," accompanied Mr. Titmarsh in his "Journey
from Cornhill to Cairo." The prize novels contain imitations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the writings of some contemporaries who still live and flourish in
the novelists' calling. I myself had scarcely entered on it when
these burlesque tales were begun, and I stopped further parody
from a sense that this merry task of making fun of the novelists
should be left to younger hands than my own; and in a little
book published some four years since, in England,
by my friends Messrs. Hannay and Shirley
Brooks, I saw a caricature of myself and writings
to the full as ludicrous and faithful as the prize
novels of Mr. Punch. Nor was there, had I desired
it, any possibility of preventing the re-appearance
of these performances. Other publishers,
besides the Messrs. Appleton, were ready to
bring my hidden works to the light. Very
many of the other books printed I have not seen since their
appearance twelve years ago, and it was with no small feelings of
curiosity (remembering under what sad circumstances the tale
had been left unfinished) that I bought the incomplete "Shabby
Genteel Story," in a railway car, on my first journey from Boston
hither, from a rosy-cheeked, little peripatetic book merchant, who
called out "Thackeray's Works" in such a kind, gay voice, as
gave me a feeling of friendship and welcome.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-200.jpg" width="91" height="126" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'There is an opportunity of being either satiric or sentimental.
The careless papers written at an early period, and never seen
since the printer's boy carried them away, are brought back and
laid at the father's door; and he cannot, if he would, forget or
disown his own children.</p>

<p>'Why were some of the little brats brought out of their
obscurity? I own to a feeling of anything but pleasure in reviewing
some of these misshapen juvenile creatures, which the publisher
has disinterred and resuscitated. There are two performances
especially (among the critical and biographical works of the
erudite Mr. Yellowplush) which I am very sorry to see reproduced;
and I ask pardon of the author of the "Caxtons" for a lampoon,
which I know he himself has forgiven, and which I wish I could
recall.</p>

<p>'I had never seen that eminent writer but once in public
when this satire was penned, and wonder at the recklessness of
the young man who could fancy such personality was harmless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
jocularity, and never calculate that it might give pain. The
best experiences of my life have been gained since that time of
youth and gaiety, and careless laughter. I allude to them, perhaps,
because I would not have any kind and friendly American
reader judge of me by the wild performances of early years. Such
a retrospect as the sight of these old acquaintances perforce occasioned
cannot, if it would, be gay. The old scenes return, the
remembrance of the bygone time, the chamber in which the stories
were written, the faces that shone round the table.</p>

<p>'Some biographers in this country have been pleased to depict
that homely apartment after a very strange and romantic fashion;
and an author in the direst struggles of poverty, waited upon by a
family domestic in "all the splendour of his menial decorations,"
has been circumstantially described to the reader's amusement as
well as to the writer's own. I may be permitted to assure the
former that the splendour and the want were alike fanciful, and
that the meals were not only sufficient but honestly paid for.</p>

<p>'That extreme liberality with which American publishers have
printed the works of English authors has had at least this beneficial
result for us, that our names and writings are known by
multitudes using our common mother tongue, who never had
heard of us or our books but for the speculators who have sent
them all over this continent.</p>

<p>'It is of course not unnatural for the English writer to hope
that some day he may share a portion of the profits which his
works bring at present to the persons who vend them in this
country; and I am bound gratefully to say myself, that since
my arrival here I have met with several publishing houses who
are willing to acknowledge our little claim to participate in the
advantages arising out of our books; and the present writer
having long since ascertained that a portion of a loaf is more
satisfactory than no bread at all, gratefully accepts and acknowledges
several slices which the book-purveyors in this city have
proffered to him of their own free-will.</p>

<p>'If we are not paid in full and in specie as yet, English writers
surely ought to be thankful for the very great kindness and friendliness
with which the American public receives them; and if in
hope some day that measures may pass here to legalise our right
to profit a little by the commodities which we invent and in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
we deal, I for one can cheerfully say that the good-will towards us
from publishers and public is undoubted, and wait for still better
times with perfect confidence and good-humour.</p>

<p>'If I have to complain of any special hardship, it is not that
our favourite works are reproduced, and our children introduced
to the American public&mdash;children whom we have educated with
care, and in whom we take a little paternal pride&mdash;but that ancient
magazines are ransacked, and shabby old articles dragged out,
which we had gladly left in the wardrobes where they have lain
hidden many years. There is no control, however, over a man's
thoughts&mdash;once uttered and printed, back they may come upon us
on any sudden day; and in this collection which Messrs. Appleton
are publishing I find two or three such early productions of my
own that I gladly would take back, but that they have long since
gone out of the paternal guardianship.</p>

<p>'If not printed in this series, they would have appeared from
other presses, having not the slightest need of the author's own
imprimatur; and I cannot sufficiently condole with a literary gentleman
of this city, who (in his voyages of professional adventure)
came upon an early performance of mine, which shall be nameless,
carried the news of the discovery to a publisher of books, and
had actually done me the favour to sell my book to that liberal
man; when, behold, Messrs. Appleton announced the book in
the press, and my <i>confrère</i> had to refund the prize-money which
had been paid to him. And if he is a little chagrined at finding
other intrepid voyagers beforehand with him in taking possession
of my island, and the American flag already floating there, he will
understand the feelings of the harmless but kindly-treated aboriginal,
who makes every sign of peace, who smokes the pipe of submission,
and meekly acquiesces in his own annexation.</p>

<p>'It is said that those only who win should laugh: I think, in
this case, my readers will not grudge the losing side its share of
harmless good-humour. If I have contributed to theirs, or provided
them with means of amusement, I am glad to think my
books have found favour with the American public, as I am proud
to own the great and cordial welcome with which they have
received me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>Such words could not fail to be gratifying to the American
people, as an evidence of Thackeray's sense of the reception he
had received; and in spite of
a subsequent slight misunderstanding
founded on a mistake
and speedily cleared up, it
may be said that no English
writer of fiction was ever more
popular in the United States.</p>

<img src="images/i-203.jpg" width="190" height="279" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The publication of the
'Adventures of Henry Esmond,'
which appeared just as its
author was starting for America in 1852, marked an important
epoch in his career. It was a continuous story, and one worked
out with closer attention to the thread of the narrative than he
had hitherto produced&mdash;a fact due, no doubt, partly to its appearance
in three volumes complete, instead of in detached monthly
portions. But its most striking feature was its elaborate imitation
of the style and even
the manner of thought of the
time of Queen Anne's reign,
in which its scenes were laid.
The preparation of his Lectures
on the Humourists had
no doubt suggested to him the
idea of writing a story of this
kind, as it afterwards suggested
to him the design of writing a
history of that period which he
had long entertained, but in
which he had, we believe, made
no progress when he died. But
his fondness for the Queen
Anne writers was of older date.
Affectionate allusions to Sir
Richard Steele&mdash;like himself a
Charterhouse boy&mdash;and to Addison,
and Pope, and Swift, may be found in his earliest magazine
articles. That the style with which the author of 'Vanity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Fair' and 'Pendennis' had so often delighted his readers was to
some degree formed upon those models so little studied in his
boyhood, cannot be doubted
by anyone who is familiar
with the literature
of the 'Augustan age of
English authorship.' The
writers of that period were
fond of French models, as
the writers of Elizabeth's
time looked to Italy for
their literary inspiration;
but there was no time when
English prose was generally
written with more purity
and ease; for the translation
of the Scriptures, which is
generally referred to as an
evidence of the perfection
of our English speech in
Elizabeth's time, owed its
strength and simplicity chiefly to the rejection by the pious translators
of the scholarly style most in vogue, in favour of the homely
English then current among the people. If we except the pamphlet
writers of earlier reigns, the Queen Anne writers were the
first who systematically wrote for the people in plain Saxon
English, not easy to imitate in these days. 'Esmond' was from
the first most liked among literary men who can appreciate a style
having no resemblance to the fashion of the day; but there was a
vein of tenderness and true pathos in the story which, in spite of
some objectionable features in the plot, and of a somewhat wearisome
genealogical introduction, has by degrees gained for it a
high rank among the author's works. 'Esmond' was followed by
the 'Newcomes,' in 1855, a work which revealed a deeper pathos
than any of his previous novels, and showed that the author could,
when he pleased, give us pictures of moral beauty and exquisite
tenderness. In this work he returned to the yellow numbers in the
old monthly form.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-204.jpg" width="205" height="259" alt="" />
</div>

<p>An incident in connection with the publication of the 'Newcomes'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
may here be mentioned. Thackeray's fondness for irony
had frequently brought him into disgrace with people not so
ready as himself in understanding that dangerous figure. A
passage in one of his chapters of this story alluding to 'Mr. Washington,'
in a parody of the style of the 'British Patriot' of the
time of the War of Independence, was so far misunderstood in
America that the fact was alluded to by the New York correspondent
of the 'Times.' Upon which the
author felt it worth his while to explain the
real sense of the offending paragraph in a letter
to that journal, and, in the concluding paragraph,
he very explicitly sets forth his own
sincere convictions in regard to the hero of
American Independence, and his belief in the
justice of the cause for which he conquered.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>

<p>Another journey to the United States,
equally successful, and equally profitable in
a pecuniary sense, was the chief event in his
life in 1856. The lectures delivered were
those admirable anecdotal and reflective discourses
on the 'Four Georges,' made familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
to readers by their publication in the 'Cornhill Magazine,'
and since then in a separate form. The subject was not favourable
to the display of the author's more genial qualities. But
where in English literature could we find anything more solemn
and affecting than his picture of the old king, the third of that
name? When 'all light, all reason, all sound of human voices,
all the pleasures of this world of God were taken from him'&mdash;concluding
with the affecting appeal to his American audience&mdash;'O
brothers! speaking the same dear mother tongue&mdash;O comrades!
enemies no more, let us take a mournful hand together as
we stand by this royal corpse, and call a truce to battle! Low he
lies to whom the proudest used to kneel once, and who was cast
lower than the poorest&mdash;dead whom millions prayed for in vain.
Hush, Strife and Quarrels, over the solemn grave! Sound, Trumpets,
a mournful march. Fall, Dark Curtain, upon his pageant, his
pride, his grief, his awful tragedy!'</p>

<p>These lectures were successfully repeated in England. Thackeray,
indeed, was now recognised as one of the most attractive
lecturers of the day. His presence, whether in lecturing
on the 'Georges' for his own profit, or on 'Week-day Preachers,'
or some other topic for the benefit of the families of deceased
brother writers, such as he delivered to assist in raising monuments
to the memories of Angus B. Reach and Douglas
Jerrold, always attracted the most cultivated classes of the
various cities in which he appeared; but an attempt to draw
together a large audience of the less-educated classes by giving a
course of lectures at the great Music Hall was less happy. In
Edinburgh his reception was always in the highest degree successful.
He was more extensively known and admired among the
intellectual portion of the people of Scotland than any living
writer, not excepting Thomas Carlyle. There was something in
his peculiar genius that commended him to the Northern temperament.
Thackeray delivered his essays on the 'Four Georges'
in Scotland to larger and more intellectual audiences than have
probably flocked to any other lecturer, and he, later on, lectured
there for the benefit of Angus B. Reach's widow. Nearly all the
men of Edinburgh, with any tincture of literature, had met him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
personally, and a few knew him well. He was almost the only
great author that the majority of the lovers of literature in it had
seen and heard, and his form and figure and voice, with its tragic
tones and pauses, well entitled him to take his place in any ideal
rank of giants. He was much gratified (says James Hannay) by
the success of the 'Four Georges' (a series which superseded an
earlier scheme for as many discourses on 'Men of the World')
in Scotland. 'I have had three per cent. of the whole population
here,' he wrote from Edinburgh in November 1856. 'If I could
but get three per cent. out of London!'</p>

<p>Most of Thackeray's readers will remember that in 1857 he
was invited by some friends to offer himself as a candidate for
the representation in Parliament of the city of Oxford.</p>

<p>A characteristic anecdote was told in the newspapers relating
to the Oxford election by one who was staying with Thackeray
at his hotel during his contest with Mr. Cardwell. Whilst
looking out of window a crowd passed along the street, hooting
and handling rather roughly some of his opponent's supporters.
Thackeray started up in the greatest possible excitement, and,
using some strong expletive, rushed down stairs, and notwithstanding
the efforts of numerous old electioneerers to detain him,
who happened to be of opinion that a trifling correction of the
opposite party might be beneficial <i>pour encourager les autres</i>, he
was not to be deterred, and was next seen towering above the
crowd, dealing about him right and left in defence of the partisans
of his antagonist and in defiance of his own friends.

<h3>MICROCOSMOGRAPHY (1628),<br />

<span class="s08">OR A PIECE OF THE WORLD DISCOVERED IN ESSAYS AND CHARACTERS.</span></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By JOHN EARLE, D.D., Bishop of Salisbury.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Preface to the Edition of 1732.</i></p>

<p>This little book had six editions between 1628 and 1633, without
any author's name to recommend it. An eighth edition is spoken
of in 1664. The present is reprinted from the edition of 1633,
without altering anything but the plain errors of the press, and the
old printing and spelling in some places.</p>

<p>The language is generally easy, and proves our English
tongue not to be so very changeable as is commonly supposed.
The change of fashions unavoidably casts a shade upon a few
places, yet even those contain an exact picture of the age wherein
they were written, as the rest does of mankind in general; for
reflections founded upon nature will be just in the main, as long
as men are men, though the particular instances of vice and folly
may be diversified. Perhaps these valuable essays may be as
acceptable to the public as they were at first; both for the entertainment
of those who are already experienced in the ways of
mankind, and for the information of others who would know the
world the best way, that is&mdash;without trying it.

<p>'This entertaining little book is become rather scarce, and is
replete with so much good sense and genuine humour, which,
though in part adapted to the times when it first appeared, seems
on the whole by no means inapplicable to any era of mankind.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Earle's 'Microcosmography' is undoubtedly a favourable
example of the quaint epigrammatic wisdom of the early English
writers, and few could question the appropriateness of the pencil
which has lightly margined the settings of these terse and sterling
essays, to the wisdom and humour of which the happiest productions
of later essayists can but be appreciatively likened. Concerning
the profoundly accomplished and eminently modest author,
'a most eloquent and powerful preacher, a man of great piety and
devotion; and of a conversation so pleasant and delightful, so very
innocent, and so very facetious, that no man's company was more
desired and more loved; no man was more negligent in his
dress, habit, and mien, no man more wary and cultivated in his
behaviour and discourse; insomuch as he had the greater advantage
when he was known, by promising so little before,' we may
accept the testimony of Lord Clarendon's 'Account of his own
Life.' The observations of the great Chancellor are supplemented
by the character which honest Isaac Walton has sketched of this
estimable prelate in his 'Life of Hooker.'</p>

<p>'... Dr. Earle, now Lord Bishop of Salisbury,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
 of whom I
may justly say (and let it not offend him, because it is such a
truth as ought not to be concealed from posterity, or those that
now live and yet know him not) that since Mr. Hooker died,
none have lived whom God hath blessed with more innocent
wisdom, more sanctified learning, or a more pious, peaceable,
primitive temper; so that this excellent person seems to be only
like himself, and our venerable Richard Hooker.'

<p>Is a man in a small letter, yet the best copy of Adam before he
tasted of Eve or the apple; and he is happy whose small practice
in the world can only write his character. He is nature's fresh
picture newly drawn in oil, which time, and much handling, dims
and defaces. His soul is yet a white paper unscribbled with observations
of the world, wherewith at length it becomes a blurred notebook.
He is purely happy because he knows no evil, nor hath
made means by sin to be acquainted with misery. He arrives not
at the mischief of being wise, nor endures evils to come by foreseeing
them. He kisses and loves all, and, when the smart of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
rod is past, smiles on his beater. Nature, and his parents alike,
dandle him, and 'tice him on with a bit of sugar to a draught of
wormwood. He plays yet like a young 'prentice the first day, and
is not come to his task of melancholy.</p>

<p>All the language he speaks yet is tears, and they serve him well
enough to express his necessity. His hardest labour is his tongue,
as if he were loth to use so deceitful an organ, and he is best company
with it when he can but prattle. We laugh at his foolish
sports, but his game is our earnest, and his drums, rattles, and
hobby-horses, but the emblems and mocking of man's business.
His father hath writ him as his own little story, wherein he reads
those days of his life that he cannot remember, and sighs to see
what innocence he hath outlived. The older he grows, he is a star
lower from God; and, like his first father, much worse in his
breeches. He is the Christian's example, and the old man's
relapse; the one imitates his pureness, and the other falls into his
simplicity. Could he put off his body with his little coat, he had
got eternity without a burden, and exchanged but one heaven for
another.</p>

<p>An upstart country knight is a holiday
clown, and differs only in the stuff of
his clothes, not the stuff of himself,
for he bare the king's sword before
he had arms to wield it; yet being
once laid o'er the shoulder with a
knighthood, he finds the herald his
friend. His father was a man of
good stock, though but a tanner or
usurer; he purchased the land, and
his son the title. He has doffed off
the name of a country lout, but the
look not so easy, and his face still
bears a relish of churn milk. He is
guarded with more gold lace than all
the gentlemen of the country, yet his
body makes his clothes still out of fashion. His housekeeping
is seen much in the distinct families of dogs, and serving-men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
attendant on their kennels, and the deepness of their throats is
the depth of his discourse.</p>

<p>A justice of peace he is to domineer in his parish, and do his
neighbour wrong with more right. He will be drunk with his
hunters for company, and stain his gentility with drippings of ale.
He is fearful of being sheriff of the shire by instinct, and dreads
the assize week as much as the prisoner.</p>

<p>In sum, he's but a clod of his own earth, or his land is the
dunghill, and he the cock that crows over it; and commonly his
race is quickly run, and his children's children, though they 'scape
hanging, return to the place from whence they came.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">A Plain Country-Fellow.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-212.jpg" width="338" height="159" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A plain country-fellow is one that manures his ground well,
but lets himself lie fallow and untilled. He has reason enough to
do his business, and not enough to be idle and melancholy.
He seems to have the punishment of Nebuchadnezzar, for his
conversation is among beasts, and his talons none of the shortest,
only he eats not grass because he loves not salads. His hand
guides the plough, and the plough his thoughts, and his ditch and
landmark is the very mound of his meditations. He expostulates
with his oxen very understandingly, and speaks gee, and ree,
better than English. His mind is not much distracted with
objects, but if a good fat sow come in his way, he stands dumb
and astonished, and though his haste be never so great, will fix
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
here half an hour's contemplation. His habitation is some poor
thatched roof, distinguished from his barn by the loop-holes that
let out smoke, which the rain had long since washed through, but
for the double ceiling of bacon on the inside, which has hung there
from his grandsire's time, and is yet to make rashers for posterity.
His dinner is his other work, for he sweats at it as much as at his
labour; he is a terrible fastener on a piece of beef, and you may
hope to stave the guard off sooner. His religion is part of his
copyhold, which he takes from his landlord, and refers it wholly to
his discretion. Yet if he give him leave he is a good Christian to
his power&mdash;that is, comes to church in his best clothes, and sits
there with his neighbours, where he is capable only of two prayers,
for rain, and fair weather. He apprehends God's blessings only in
a good year, or a fat pasture, and never praises Him but on <i>good
ground</i>. Sunday he esteems a day to make merry in, and thinks a
bagpipe as essential to it as evening prayer, when he walks very
solemnly after service with his hands coupled behind him, and
censures the dancing of his parish. His compliment with his
neighbour is a good thump on the back, and his salutation commonly
some blunt curse. He thinks nothing to be vices, but pride
and ill husbandry, from which he will gravely dissuade the youth,
and has some thrifty hob-nail proverbs to clout his discourse. He
is a niggard all the week, except only market days, when, if his corn
sell well, he thinks he may be drunk with a good conscience. He
is sensible of no calamity but the burning of a stack of corn, or the
overflowing of a meadow, and thinks Noah's flood the greatest
plague that ever was, not because it drowned the world, but
spoiled the grass. For death he is never troubled, and if he get
in but his harvest before, let it come when it will, he cares not.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">A Pot Poet.</span></p>

<p>A pot poet is the dregs of wit, yet mingled with good drink
may have some relish. His inspirations are more real than others,
for they do but feign a god, but he has his by him. His verse runs
like the tap, and his invention as the barrel ebbs and flows at the
mercy of the spiggot. In thin drink he aspires not above a ballad,
but a cup of sack inflames him, and sets his muse and nose a-fire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
together. The press is his mint, and stamps him now and then a sixpence
or two in reward of the baser coin, his pamphlet. His works
would scarce sell for three halfpence, though they are given oft for
three shillings, but for the pretty title that allures the country gentleman;
for which the printer maintains him in ale for a fortnight.
His verses are, like his clothes, miserable stolen scraps and
patches, yet their pace is not altogether so hobbling as an almanac's.
The death of a great man, or the burning of a house,
furnish him with an argument, and the nine muses are out strait in
mourning gowns, and Melpomene cries 'Fire! fire!' His other
poems are but briefs in rhyme, and, like the poor Greek's collections,
to redeem from captivity.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-214.jpg" width="248" height="164" alt="" />
</div>

<p>His frequentest works go out in single sheets, and are chanted
from market to market to a vile tune and a viler throat; whilst the
poor country wench melts like her butter to hear them. And these
are the stories of some men of Tyburn, or of a strange monster
broken loose; or sitting in a tap-room he writes sermons on
judgments. He drops away at last, and his life, like a can too
full, spills upon the bench. He leaves twenty shillings on the
score, which his hostess loses.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">A Bowl Alley.</span></p>

<p>A bowl alley is the place where there are three things thrown
away besides bowls&mdash;to wit, time, money, and curses, and the last
ten for one. The best sport in it is the gamesters, and he enjoys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
it that looks on and bets not. It is the school of wrangling, and
worse than the schools, for men will cavil here for a hair's breadth,
and make a stir where a straw would end the controversy. No
antic screws men's bodies into such strange flexures, and you
would think them here senseless, to speak sense to their bowl, and
put their trust in entreaties for a good cast. It is the best discovery
of humours, especially in the losers, where you have fine
variety of impatience, whilst some fret, some rail, some swear, and
others more ridiculously comfort themselves with philosophy. To
give you the moral of it, it is the emblem of the world, or the
world's ambition; where most are short, or over, or wide, or wrong-biassed,
and some few justle in to the mistress of fortune. And it
is here as in the court, where the nearest are most spited, and all
blows aimed at the toucher.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-215-copy.jpg" width="112" height="137" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A handsome hostess is the fairer commendation
of an inn, above the fair sign, or
fair lodgings. She is the loadstone that
attracts men of iron, gallants and roarers,
where they cleave sometimes long, and are
not easily got off. Her lips are your welcome,
and your entertainment her company,
which is put into the reckoning too,
and is the dearest parcel in it. No citizen's
wife is demurer than she at the first greeting, nor draws in
her mouth with a chaster simper; but you may be more familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
without distaste, and she does not startle at a loose jest. She is the
confusion of a pottle of sack more than would have been spent
elsewhere, and her little jugs are accepted to have her kiss excuse
them. She may be an honest woman, but is not believed so in her
parish, and no man is a greater infidel in it than her husband.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">A Poor Fiddler.</span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-216.jpg" width="109" height="132" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A poor fiddler is a man and a fiddle out of
case, and he in worse case than his fiddle.
One that rubs two sticks together (as the
Indians strike fire), and rubs a poor
living out of it; partly from this, and
partly from your charity, which is more
in the hearing than giving him, for he
sells nothing dearer than to be gone.
He is just so many strings above a
beggar, though he have but two; and yet he begs too. Hunger
is the greatest pain he takes, except a broken head sometimes.
Otherwise his life is so many fits of mirth, and 'tis some mirth
to see him. A good feast shall draw him five miles by the nose,
and you shall track him again by the scent. His other pilgrimages
are fairs and good houses, where his devotion is great to
the Christmas; and no man loves good times better. He is in
league with the tapsters for the worshipful of the inn, whom he
torments next morning with his art, and has their names more
perfect than their men. A new song is better to him than a
new jacket, especially if it be lewd, which he calls merry;
and hates naturally the puritan, as an enemy to this mirth. A
country wedding and Whitsun-ale are the two main places he
domineers in, where he goes for a musician, and overlooks the
bagpipe. The rest of him is drunk, and in the stocks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">A Coward.</span></p>

<p>A coward is the man that is commonly most fierce against the
coward, and labouring to take off this suspicion from himself; for
the opinion of valour is a good protection to those that dare not
use it. No man is valianter than he is in civil company, and
where he thinks no danger may come of it, and is the readiest
man to fall upon a drawer and those that must not strike again;
wonderfully exceptious and choleric where he sees men are loth to
give him occasion, and you cannot pacify him better than by quarrelling
with him. The hotter you grow, the more temperate man
is he; he protests he always honoured you, and the more you rail
upon him, the more he honours you, and you threaten him at last
into a very honest quiet man. The sight of a sword wounds him
more sensibly than the stroke, for before that come, he is dead
already. Every man is his master that dare beat him, and every
man dares that knows him. And he who dare do this is the only
man that can do much with him; for his friend he cares not, as
a man that carries no such terror as his enemy, which for this
cause only is more potent with him of the two; and men fall out
with him on purpose to get courtesies from him, and be bribed
again to a reconcilement. A man in whom no secret can be
bound up, for the apprehension of each danger loosens him, and
makes him betray both the room and it. He is a Christian merely
for fear of hell fire; and if any religion could frighten him more,
would be of that.</p>

<h3>AN ESSAY IN DEFENCE OF THE FEMALE SEX.</h3>

<p class="center">DEDICATED TO THE PRINCESS ANNE OF DENMARK.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-219.jpg" width="207" height="243" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As this book does not bear
the reputation of being
generally familiar, we give
a slight sketch of its contents.
The vitality of a
work depends in so large
a degree on the estimation
which its subject happens
to secure at the date
of publication, that, as
a rule, it may be held
when a book is forgotten,
or extinguished before its
first spark of life has time
to catch popular attention,
the fault is its own,
and, being buried, it is a charity to allow its last rest to remain
undisturbed. We are inclined to believe, however, that this little
treatise forms an exception. The 'Essay in Defence of the
Female Sex' is written by a lady. The third edition, which
now comes under our consideration as having formed one of the
works in Thackeray's library (illustrated with original little sketches
of the characters dealt with by their authors), was published in 1697,
at the signs of the 'Black Boy' and the 'Peacock,' both in Fleet
Street. The authoress disclaims any participation in a brace of
verses which appear on its title:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'<i>Since each is fond of his own ugly face,</i></p>
<p><i>Why should you, when we hold it, break the glass?</i>'</p>

<p class="i10">Prol. to 'Sir F. Flutter.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>The second couplet appears under an engraving of the
'Compleat Beau,' an elaborate creation adjusting his curls with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
simper, whilst a left-handed barber bestows a finishing puff from
his powder-box:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">'<i>This vain gay thing set up for man,</i></p>
<p class="i1"><i>But see what fate attends him,</i></p>
<p><i>The powd'ring Barber first began,</i></p>
<p class="i1"><i>The barber-Surgeon ends him!</i>'</p>
</div></div>

<p>The paragraphs distinguished with little drawings, which we
have extracted, may give an impression that the 'defence' consists
of an attack on the male, rather than a vindication of the fair sex.
The arguments of the gentle champion are, however, temperate
and sensible, in parts; they are stated in a lively, quaint manner,
and the general quality of the book may be considered superior to
the average of its class and date. The preface, which discourses of
vanity as the mainspring of our actions, deals with the characters
it is designed to introduce in the work as with the mimic actors of
a puppet-show; this coincidence with a similar assumption in the
preface to the great novel of our century, from the pen of the gifted
author who at one time possessed this little treatise, is worthy of
a passing remark.</p>

<p>'Prefaces to most books are like prolocutors
to puppet-shows; they come first
to tell you what figures are to be presented,
and what tricks they are to play.
According, therefore, to ancient and
laudable custom, I thought fit to let you
know, by way of preface or advertisement
(call it which you please), that
here are many fine figures within to be
seen, as well worth your curiosity as
any in Smithfield at Bartholomew-tide.
I will not deny, reader, but that you may
have seen some of them there already;
to those that have I have little more to
say, than that if they have a mind to see
them again in effigy, they may do it here. What is it you would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
have? Here are St. Georges, Batemans, John Dories, Punchinelloes,
and the "Creation of the World," or what's as good, &amp;c.
The bookseller, poor man, is desirous to please you at firsthand,
and therefore has put a fine picture in the front to invite you in.'</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>Character of a Pedant.</i></p>

<p>(The Authoress alludes to scholars 'falling short' of certain qualifications.

</div>

<p>'For scholars, though by their acquaintance
with books, and conversing much
with old authors, they may know perfectly
the sense of the learned dead, and be
perfect masters of the wisdom, be thoroughly
informed of the state, and nicely
skilled in the policies of ages long since
past, yet by their retired and inactive
life, their neglect of business, and constant
conversation with antiquity, they
are such strangers to, and so ignorant
of, the domestic affairs and manners of
their own country and times, that they
appear like the ghosts of old Romans
raised by magic. Talk to them of the
Assyrian or Persian monarchies, the
Grecian or Roman commonwealths,
they answer like oracles; they are such
finished statesmen, that we should scarce take them to have been
less than confidants of Semiramis, tutors to Cyrus the Great, old
cronies of Solon and Lycurgus, or privy councillors at least to
the twelve Cæsars successively. But engage them in a discourse
that concerns the present times, and their native country, and
they hardly speak the language of it, and know so little of the
affairs of it, that as much might reasonably be expected from an
animated Egyptian mummy.</p>

<p>'They are much disturbed to see a fold or plait amiss in the
picture of an old Roman gown, yet take no notice that their own
are threadbare, out at the elbows, or ragged; or suffer more if
Priscian's head be broken than if it were their own. They are excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
guides, and can direct you to every alley and turning
in old Rome, yet lose their way at
home in their own parish. They are
mighty admirers of the wit and eloquence
of the ancients, and yet had
they lived in the time of Cicero and
Cæsar, would have treated them with
as much supercilious pride and disrespect
as they do now with reverence.
They are great hunters of ancient manuscripts,
and have in great veneration
anything that has escaped the teeth of
time and rats, and if age has obliterated
the characters 'tis the more valuable
for not being legible. But if by chance
they can pick out one word, they rate
it higher than the whole author in print,
and would give more for one proverb
of Solomon under his own hand, than for all his wisdom.'</p>

</div>

<p>Contrasting the picture of a pedant
with that of a country gentleman,
the writer states these two characters
are presented to show 'that
men may, and do often, baffle and
frustrate the effects of a liberal
education as well by industry as
negligence. For my part I think
the learned and unlearned blockhead pretty equal, for 'tis all
one to me, whether a man talk nonsense or unintelligible sense.'</p>

<p>After describing the relief experienced by the country squire
on his release from the bondage of learning, the authoress continues
her sketch:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Thus accomplished and finished for a gentleman, he enters
the civil list, and holds the scales of Justice with as much blindness
as she is said to do. From henceforward his worship becomes as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
formidable to the ale-houses as he was before familiar; he sizes an
ale-pot, and takes the dimensions of bread with great dexterity and
sagacity. He is the terror of all the deer and poultry stealers in the
neighbourhood, and is so implacable a persecutor of poachers that
he keeps a register of all the guns and dogs in the hundred, and is
the scare-beggar of the parish. Short pots, and unjustifiable dogs
and nets, furnish him with sufficient matter of presentments to
carry him once a quarter to the sessions, where he says little, eats
and drinks much, and after dinner, hunts over the last chase, and
so rides, worshipfully drunk, home again.'</p>

<p>'These are your men of
nice honour, that love
fighting for the sake of

well but when they are
wounded; they are severe
interpreters of looks, are
affronted at every face that don't please them, and like true cocks
of the game, have a quarrel with all mankind at first sight. They
are passionate admirers of scarred faces, and dote on a wooden
leg. They receive a challenge like a "billet-doux," and a home-thrust
as a favour. Their common adversary is the constable,
and their usual lodging "the counter." Broken heads are a
diversion, and an arm in a scarf is a high satisfaction. They are
frugal in their expenses with the tailor, for they have their
doublets pinked on their backs; but they are as good as an
annuity to the surgeon, though they need him not to let them
blood.'</p>

<p>'A beau is one that has more learning in his heels than his
head, which is better covered than filled. His tailor and his barber
are his cabinet council, to whom he is more beholden for what he
is than to his Maker. He is one that has travelled to see fashions,
and brought over with him the newest cut suits and the prettiest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
fancied ribands for sword-knots. He should be a philosopher,
for he studies nothing but himself, yet every one knows him better
that thinks him not worth knowing.
His looks and gestures are his constant
lesson, and his glass is the oracle that
resolves all his mighty doubts and
scruples. He examines and refreshes
his complexion by it, and is more dejected
at a pimple than if it were a
cancer. When his eyes are set to a
languishing air, his motions all prepared
according to art, his wig and his coat
abundantly powdered, his gloves essenced, and his handkerchief
perfumed, and all the rest of his bravery adjusted rightly, the
greatest part of the day, as well as
the business of it at home, is over;
'tis time to launch, and down he
comes, scented like a perfumer's
shop, and looks like a vessel with all
her rigging under sail without ballast.' ...
'He first visits the chocolate-house,
where he admires himself in
the glass, and starts a learned argument
on the newest fashions. From
hence he adjourns to the play-house, where he is to be met again
in the side box, from whence he makes his court to all the ladies
in general with his eyes, and is particular
only with the orange wench.
After a while he engages some neighbouring
vizor, and altogether they run
over all the boxes, take to pieces every
face, examine every feature, pass their
censure upon every one, and so on to
their dress; but, in conclusion, sees
nobody complete, but himself, in the
whole house. After this he looks down
with contempt upon the pit, and rallies all the slovenly fellows and
awkward "beaux," as he calls them, of the other end of the town;
is mightily offended at their ill-scented snuff, and, in spite of all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
"pulvilio" and essences, is overcome with the stink of their Cordovant
gloves. To close all, Madam in the mask must give him
an account of the scandal of the town, which she does in the
history of abundance of intrigues, real or feigned, at all of which
he laughs aloud and often, not to show his
satisfaction, but his teeth. His next stage
is Locket's, where his vanity, not his stomach,
is to be gratified with something that is little
and dear. Quails and ortolans are the
meanest of his diet, and a spoonful of green
peas at Christmas is worth more to him than
the inheritance of the field where they grow
in summer. His amours are all profound
secrets, yet he makes a confidence of them
to every man he meets with. Thus the show
goes forward, until he is beaten for trespasses
he was never guilty of, and shall be damned
for sins he never committed. At last, with
his credit as low as his fortune, he retires
sullenly to his cloister, the King's Bench or
the Fleet, and passes the rest of his days in
privacy and contemplation. Here, if you
please, we will give him one visit more, and
see the last act of the farce; and you shall
find him (whose sobriety was before a vice, as being only the
pander to his other pleasures, and who feared a lighted pipe as
much as if it had been a great gun levelled at him) with his
nose flaming, and his breath stinking of spirits worse than a Dutch
tarpaulin's, and smoking out of a short pipe, that for some months
has been kept hot as constantly as a glass-house, and so I leave
him to his meditation.'</p>

he could prove them to be mere sots and blockheads that
understand little of poetry in comparison with
himself. He is the oracle of those who want
wit, and the plague of those that have it, for he
haunts their lodgings, and is more terrible to
them than their duns. His pocket is an inexhaustible
magazine of rhyme and nonsense, and
his tongue, like a repeating clock with chimes,
is ready upon every touch to sound them. Men
avoid him for the same reason they avoid the
pillory, the security of their ears, of which he is
as merciless a prosecutor. He is the bane to society,
a friend to the stationers, the plague of the press, and the
ruin of his bookseller. He is more profitable to the grocers and
tobacconists than the paper manufacturer; for his works, which
talk so much of fire and flame, commonly expire in their shops in
vapour and smoke.'</p>

<p>'The virtuoso is one who has sold his estate in
land to purchase one in scallop, couch, and
cockle shells, and has abandoned the society
of men for that of insects, worms, grubs,
lizards, tortoises, beetles, and moths. His
study is like Noah's ark, the general rendezvous
of all creatures in the universe, and the
greatest part of his movables are the remainders
of the deluge. His travels are not designed
as visits to the inhabitants of any place,
but to the pits, shores, and hills; and from whence he fetches
not the treasure but the trumpery. He is ravished at finding an
uncommon shell or an odd-shaped stone, and is desperately enamoured
at first sight of an unusual marked butterfly, which he
will hunt a whole day to be master of. He traffics to all places,
and has his correspondents in every part of the world. He preserves
carefully those creatures which other men industriously destroy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
and cultivates sedulously those plants which others root up
as weeds. His cash consists much in old coins, and he thinks
the face of Alexander on one of them worth more than all his
conquests.'</p>

<p>After describing the contests in Flanders
being re-fought by the newsmongers in
the coffee-houses, the sketch proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Our greatest actions must be buffooned
in show as well as talk. Shall
Namur be taken and our heroes of the
city not show their prowess upon so
great an occasion? It must never be
said that the coffee-houses dared more
than Moorfields. No; for the honour of London, out comes the
foreman of the shop, very formidable in buff and bandoleers, and
away he marches, with feather in cap, to the general rendezvous
in the Artillery Ground. There these terrible mimics of Mars
are to spend their fury in noise and smoke upon a Namur erected
for that purpose on a molehill, and by the help of guns and drums
out-stink and out-rattle Smithfield in all its bravery, and would
be too hard for the greatest man in all France, if they had him
but amongst them. Yet this is but skirmishing, the hot service
is in another place, when they engage the capons and quart pots;
never was onset more vigorous, for they come to handy blows
immediately, and now is the real cutting and slashing, and tilting
without quarter: were the towns in Flanders all walled with beef,
and the French as good meat as capons, and dressed the same way,
the king need never beat his drums for soldiers; and all these
gallant fellows would come in voluntarily, the meanest of which
would be able to eat a marshal.'</p>

<p>These descriptions of character are concluded by contrasts
drawn between the virtues and vices of the respective sexes, and
the authoress remarks that if the masses are to be measured by
the instances of either Tullia, Claudia, or Messalina, by Sardanapalus,
Nero, or Caligula, the human race will certainly be found
the vilest part of the creation.

<h3>'LA MAGIE ET L'ASTROLOGIE,'</h3>

<p class="center">Par <span class="smcap">L. F. Alfred Maury</span>.</p>

<p>'La Magie et l'Astrologie
dans l'Antiquité et au
Moyen Age; ou, Étude sur
les Superstitions Païennes
qui se sont perpétuées
jusqu'à nos jours.' This
work, in two parts, by
the author of 'Les Premiers
Ages de la Nature'
and 'Une Histoire des
Religions,' gives evidence
of wide-spread research.
To the curious in 'dark'
literature, A. Maury's
compilation must form a vastly concise and interesting introduction
to a subject which once absorbed a large proportion of the
erudition and 'fond' wisdom of our ancestors. From its high
seat amidst kings and profound sages, cabalistic art has, in this
practical age, sunk so low that its exclusive privilege may be
considered the delectation and delusion of the most forlorn
ignorance.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-233.jpg" width="215" height="209" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is, indeed, a source of congratulation that magic and astrology
in our day rarely rise above the basement (for their modern patrons
inhabit the kitchen), unless they are admitted in the palpable
form of 'parlour necromancy,' degenerating into mere manual
dexterity and common-place conjuring tricks.</p>

<p>A. Maury's work traces the progress of magic from its source
among uncivilised nations, and in the earliest ages, through the
history of the Chaldeans, the Persians, the Egyptians, the Greeks,
and the Romans. He exhibits the struggle of Christianity with
magic, until the greater power overcame vain superstitions. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
then follows its evil track through the middle ages, and illustrates
in the observances of astrology, an imitation of Pagan rites.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-234.jpg" width="251" height="386" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the Second Part the author reviews the subject of superstitions
attaching to dreams, and defines their employment as a
means of divination, from the earliest records down to a recent
period. He then describes the demoniac origin, once attributed
to mental and nervous derangements, and elucidates the
assistance contributed by the imagination to the deceptions of
so-called magic. He concludes by considering the production
of mental phenomena by the use of narcotics, the destruction
of reason and of the intellectual faculties, and closes his summary
by treating of hypnotism and somnambulism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>In the chapter describing the influence of magic on the
teachings of the Neoplatonic school of philosophy, we find the
arguments advanced in the paragraphs we extract,
wittily and practically embodied in a little
sketch of an antique divinity, introduced with
modern attributes.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-235.jpg" width="62" height="168" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'... The new school of Plato imagined a
complete hierarchy of demons, with which they
combined a portion of the divinities of the ancient
Greek religion, reconstructed in a newer
and more philosophical spirit.</p>

<p>'In the doctrines expounded by the author
of the "Mystères des Egyptiens," who had borrowed
most of his ideas from the Egyptian theology,
demons are represented as veritable divinities, who divide
the government of the world with the deities.</p>

<p>'The inconsistent chronological confusion which prevailed at
that period frequently offers similar contradictions; for the doctrines
of antiquity, while taking their position in the new philosophy,
had not been submitted to the modifications necessary to
bring them into harmony with the later system.</p>

<p>'... The severity directed by Church and State against
magicians and sorcerers was not solely inspired by the terrors of
demons or a dread of witchcraft.</p>

<p>'... Although there existed in the rites of magic many
foolish ceremonials that were harmless and inoffensive, the perpetuation
of the observances of the ancient Polytheism were,
however, employed as a veil, beneath which existed practices that
were absolutely criminal, stamped with the most atrocious and
sanguinary superstitions. The preparation of poisons played a
considerable part in these observances, and witchcraft was not
entirely confined to mere influences on the mind. Those who
connected themselves with sorcery most frequently employed it
with a view of gratifying either personal vengeance or culpable
covetousness.'</p>

<p>In the chapter on '<i>Possession Démoniaque</i>,' devoted to the
demoniacal origin attributed to nervous and mental afflictions, we
find a quaint pencil-heading which precedes the extracts we have
made, to explain the matter it illustrates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-236.jpg" width="326" height="399" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'... The ancients no more succeeded in mastering the
natural character and physical origin of disease than they were
able to recognise the constancy of the phenomena of the universe.</p>

<p>'All descriptions of sickness, especially epidemics and mental
or nervous affections, were particularly reputed of supernatural
agency; the first on account of their unexpected approaches, and
their contagious and deadly effects; the second on the grounds of
their mysterious origin, and the profound affections they bring
either to the mind, the muscular system, or the sensations.</p>

<p>'When an epidemic broke out they immediately concluded
that a divinity was abroad, sent forth to execute vengeance or to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
inflict just corrections. They then employed their faculties in
searching for a motive that might have provoked his anger, and
they strove to appease his wrath by sacrifices;
or they sought to avert the effects
of evil by ceremonies, by purifications,
and exorcisms.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-237-copy.jpg" width="405" height="333" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Their legends record that the deities
of evil have been seen riding through the
air, scattering death and desolation far
and wide.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-237.jpg" width="217" height="126" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'... A passage in Minutius Felix
(Octav. c. 29, which confirms Saint Cyprien
ad Demetrian. p. 501, et Lactance, Inst.
Div. Il. xv.; cf. Kopp, "Palæographia Critica," t. iii. p. 75) informs
us that in order to constrain the demon to declare, through
the mouth of the person
supposed to be thus possessed,
that he was driven
out, recourse was had to
blows, and to the employment
of barbarous methods.
This will at once explain
the apparent successes of
certain exorcists, and the
ready compliance with which the devils responded to their conjurations.
The signs by which the departure of the evil spirit
were recognised were naturally very varied. Pious legends make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
frequent mention of demons that have been expelled, and have
been seen to proceed, with terrible cries, from the mouths of those
so possessed.'</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-238.jpg" width="132" height="242" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The two priestly figures, which are found at the commencement
of this short <i>résumé</i> of Alfred Maury's work, might be readily
assumed to embody the characteristics of magic and astrology.
They are drawn on a fly-leaf in the original, and on the corresponding
leaf at the end is pencilled the richly quaint conception,
which appropriately concludes the summary of contents.

<h3>MAGIC, WITCHCRAFT, ANIMAL MAGNETISM,
HYPNOTISM, AND ELECTRO BIOLOGY.</h3>

<hr class="l15" />
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">Amicus Plato, amicus Socrates, sed magis amica Veritas.</p>
</div>
<hr class="l15" />
<p>Mr. Braid has selected a
neat motto for his treatise,
for the matter contained
in it will hardly warrant
the assumption of a more
ambitious title.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-239.jpg" width="223" height="325" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Braid, of Burlington
House, Manchester,
a doctor by profession, is
a believer in and exponent
of hypnotism. A
great portion of his little
work reviews the criticisms
on earlier editions,
or deals with statements
regarding Colquhoun's
'History of Magic.' Its
author, while rejecting the
doctrines known as animal
mesmerism and magnetism,
admits the effects
they are declared to produce; but he refers such results to hypnotism&mdash;a
state of induced sleep&mdash;into which a patient may be
thrown by artificial contrivance.</p>

<p>It is possible that the contents of this book would not prove
of much general interest excepting to amateurs of 'animal magnetism;'
but we give one extract, which may prove of service to
those who do not happen to be already informed of the theory it
advances, which is one that every reader can practically test:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>'In my work on hypnotism,' observes Mr. Braid, 'published
in 1843, I explained how "tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy
sleep," might be procured, in
many instances, through a most
simple device, by the patient
himself. All that is required
for this purpose is simply to
place himself in a comfortable
posture in bed, and then to
close the eyelids, and turn up
the eyeballs gently, as if looking
at a distant object, such
as an imaginary star, situated
somewhat above and behind the forehead, giving the whole concentrated
attention of the mind to the idea of maintaining a
steady view of the star, and breathing softly, as if in profound
attention, the mind at the same time yielding to the idea that
sleep will ensue, and to the tendency to somnolence which will
creep upon him whilst engaged in this act of fixed attention. Mr.
Walker's method of "procuring sleep at will," by desiring the
patient to maintain a fixed act of attention by imagining himself
watching his breath issuing slowly from his nostrils, after having
placed his body in a comfortable position in bed, which was first
published by Dr. Binns, is essentially the same as my own
method, &amp;c.'</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-240.jpg" width="198" height="156" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Professor Gregory, in his 'Letters to a Candid Inquirer,' after
describing the induction of sleep effected by reading a class of
books of a dry character, remarks: 'But let these persons
(sufferers from a difficulty in getting off to sleep) try the experiment
of placing a small bright object, seen by the reflection of a
safe and distant light, in such a position that the eyes are strained
a little upwards or backwards, and at such a distance as to give a
tendency to squinting, and they will probably never again have
recourse to the venerable authors above alluded to. Sir David
Brewster, who, with more than youthful ardour, never fails to
investigate any curious fact connected with the eye, has not only
seen Mr. Braid operate, but has also himself often adopted this
method of inducing sleep, and compares it to the feeling we have
when, after severe and long-continued bodily exertion, we sit or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
lie down and fall asleep, being overcome, in a most agreeable
manner, by the solicitations of Morpheus, to which, at such times,
we have a positive pleasure in yielding, however inappropriate the
scene of our slumbers.'</p>

</div>

<p>Among the contents are numerous instances of magnetism,
and anecdotes of experiments, which have been amusingly 'hit
off' in little marginal sketches. One of the best of these is an
illustration of the contagious dancing mania said to be excited by
the bite of the tarantula spider&mdash;'against the effect of which
neither youth nor age afforded any protection, so that old men of
ninety threw away their crutches,' and the very sight of those so
affected was equally potent. These sketches are, however, so
small that we think it advisable to exclude them from our selection.
The pantomimic mesmerism produced by the harlequin's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
magic wand, and practically seconded by the sly slaps of the
clown, are happily given on the fly-leaf of the treatise; and a
vastly original and startling result of animal magnetism records on
the last page the droller impressions of the artist-reader on the
subject, through the medium of his pencil.</p>

<p>The commencement of the eighteenth century
has been christened the Augustan Era
of English literature, from the brilliant assembly
of writers, pre-eminent for their
wit, genius, and cultivation, who then enriched
our literature with a perfectly original
school of humour.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-243.jpg" width="136" height="184" alt="" />

<p>The essayists, to whose accomplished
parts we are indebted for the 'Tatlers,'
'Spectators,' 'Guardians,' 'Humorists,'
'Worlds,' 'Connoisseurs,' 'Mirrors,'
'Adventurers,' 'Observers,' 'Loungers,'
'Lookers-on,' 'Ramblers,' and kindred papers, which picture the
many-coloured scenes of our society and literature, have conferred
a lasting benefit upon posterity by the sterling merit of their writings.
It has been justly said that these essays, by their intrinsic worth,
have outlived many revolutions of taste, and have attained unrivalled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
popularity and classic fame, while multitudes of their contemporaries,
successors, and imitators have perished with the accidents
or caprices of fashion.</p>

<p>The general purpose of the essayists as laid down by Steele, who
may be considered foremost among the originators of the familiar
school of writing, 'was to expose the false arts of life, to pull off the
disguises of cunning, vanity, and affectation, and to recommend a
general simplicity in our dress, our discourse, and our behaviour.'
Bickerstaff's lucubrations were directed to good-humoured exposures
of those freaks and vagaries of life, 'too trivial for the
chastisement of the law and too fantastical for the cognisance of the
pulpit,' of those failings, according to Addison's summary of their
purpose in the 'Spectator' (No. 34), thus harmonised by Pope:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Safe from the bar, the pulpit, and the throne,</p>
<p>Yet touched and shamed by Ridicule alone.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The graceful philosophers, polished wits and playful satirists exerted
their abilities to supply 'those temporary demands and casual exigencies,
overlooked by graver writers and more bulky theorists,' to
bring, in the language of Addison, 'philosophy out of closets and
libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at
tea-tables and in coffee-houses.'</p>

<p>'The method of conveying cheap and easy knowledge began
among us in the civil wars, when it was much the interest of either
party to raise and fix the prejudices of the people.' It was in this
spirit that the oft-mentioned Mercuries, 'Mercurius Aulicus,'
'Mercurius Rusticus,' and 'Mercurius Civicus' first appeared.</p>

<p>A hint of the original plan of the 'Tatler' may in some degree
be traced to Defoe's 'Review; consisting of a Scandal Club, on
Questions of Theology, Morals, Politics, Trade, Language, Poetry,
&amp;c.,' published about the year 1703.</p>

<p>'The "Tatler,"' writes Dr. Chalmers, 'like many other ancient
superstructures, rose from small beginnings. It does not appear
that the author (Steele) foresaw to what perfection this method of
writing could be brought. By dividing each paper into compartments,
he appears to have consulted the ease with which an
author may say a little upon many subjects, who has neither
leisure nor inclination to enter deeply on a single topic. This,
however, did not proceed either from distrust in his abilities, or in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the favour of the public; for he at once addressed them with confidence
and familiarity; but it is probable that he did not foresee
to what perfection the continued practice of writing will frequently
lead a man whose natural endowments are wit and eloquence,
superadded to a knowledge of the world, and a habit of observation.'</p>

<p>The first number of the 'Tatler' bore the motto,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Quicquid agunt homines&mdash;</p>
<p class="i5">nostri est farrago libelli.&mdash;Juv. Sat. I. 85, 86.</p>

<p>The original sheet appeared on Tuesday, April 12, 1709,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
 and
the days of its publication were fixed to be Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Saturdays. 'In the selection of a name for the work, Steele
affords an early instance of delicate raillery, by informing us that
the name "Tatler" was invented in <i>honour</i> of the fair sex; and
that in such a character he might indulge with impunity the
desultory plan he first laid down, with a becoming imitation of the
tattle and gossip of the day.' The first four numbers were given
gratis, the price was then fixed at a penny, which was afterwards
doubled.</p>

<p>Steele, whose humour was most happily adapted to his task,
assumed as censor of manners the alias of Isaac Bickerstaff.
'Throughout the whole work,' writes Beattie, 'the conjuror, the
politician, the man of humour, the critic; the seriousness of the
moralist, and the mock dignity of the astrologer; the vivacities
and infirmities peculiar to old age, are all so blended and contrasted
in the censor of Great Britain as to form a character equally complex
and natural, equally laughable and respectable,' and as the
editor declares, in his proper person, 'the attacks upon prevailing
and fashionable vices had been carried forward by Mr. Bickerstaff
with a freedom of spirit that would have lost its attraction and
efficacy, had it been pretended to by <i>Mr. Steele</i>.'</p>

<p>A scarce pamphlet, attributed to Gay, draws attention to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
high moral and philosophic purpose which was entertained originally.
'There was this difference between Steele and all the rest
of the polite and gallant authors of the time: the latter endeavoured
to please the age by falling in with them, and encouraging them in
their fashionable vices and false notions of things. It would have
been a jest some time since for a man to have asserted that anything
witty could have been said in praise of a married state; or
that devotion and virtue were any way necessary to the character
of a fine gentleman. Bickerstaff ventured to tell the town that
they were a parcel of fops, fools, and vain coquettes; but in such
a manner as even pleased them, and made them more than half
inclined to believe that he spoke truth.'</p>

<p>The humorists of the Augustan era were, as the world knows,
peculiar objects of regard to the great writer of 'Roundabout
Essays' in the age of Queen Victoria. Novels, lectures, and
reviews alike prove the industry and affection with which Thackeray
conducted his researches amidst the veins of singular richness and
congenial material opened to him by the lives and writings of
these famous essayists, in such profusion that selection became a
point of real art.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to trace the results of Thackeray's reading
among his favourite writers, or to watch its influence on his own
compositions. Nor did his regard for these sources of inspiration
pass the bounds of reasonable admiration; he argues convincingly
of the authentic importance of his chosen authorities.</p>

<p>From his minute and intelligent studies of the works of these
genial humorists Thackeray acquired a remarkable facility of
thinking, spontaneously acknowledged by all his contemporaries,
with the felicitous aptitude of the originals, and learned to express
his conceptions in language simple, lucid, and sparkling as the
outpourings from those pure fonts for which his eagerness may be
said to have been unquenched to the end of his career.</p>

<p>That artist-like local colouring which gives such scholarly value
to 'Henry Esmond,' to the 'Virginians,' to the 'Humorists of
the Eighteenth Century,' and which was no less manifest in the
work which engaged his thoughts when Death lightly touched the
novelist's hand, furnishes the evidence of Thackeray's familiarity
with, and command of, the quaintest, wittiest, wisest, and pleasantest
writings in our language.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>It will be felt by readers who realise Thackeray in his familiar
association with the kindred early humorists, that the merry
passages his pencil has italicised by droll marginal sketches are,
with all their suggestive slightness, in no degree unworthy of the
conceits to which they give a new interest; while in some cases,
with playful whimsicality, they present a reading entirely novel.
The fidelity of costume and appointments, even in this miniature
state, confirms the diligence and thought with which the author of
'Henry Esmond' pursued every detail which illustrated his
cherished period, and which might serve as a basis for its consistent
reconstruction, to carry his reader far back up the stream of time.</p>

<p>The necessity of compressing within the limits of this volume
our selections from the comparatively exhaustless field of the
humorous essayists, necessarily renders the paragraphs elucidated
by Thackeray's quaint etchings somewhat fragmentary and abrupt,
while the miscellaneous nature of the topics thus indiscriminately
touched on may be best set forth according to the advertisement
with which Swift ushered in his memorable 'Number One':</p>

<p>'All accounts of gallantry, pleasure, and entertainment shall
be under the article of <i>White's Chocolate-house</i>;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>

</p>

<p>'I once more desire my reader to consider, that as I cannot
keep an ingenious man to go daily to Will's under twopence
each day, merely for his charges; to White's, under sixpence;
nor to the Grecian, without allowing him some plain Spanish, to
be as able as others at the learned table; and that a good
observer cannot speak with even Kidney (the waiter) at St.
James's without clean linen; I say, these considerations will, I
hope, make all persons willing to comply with my humble request
(when my <i>gratis</i> stock is exhausted) of a penny apiece; especially

impossible for me to want means to entertain them, having,

that I can, by casting a figure, tell you all that may happen before
it comes to pass.'</p>

<p>Who names that lost thing love without a tear,</p>
<p>Since so debauch'd by ill-bred customs here?</p>
<p>To an exact perfection they have brought</p>
<p>The action love, the passion is forgot.</p>
</div></div>

<p>'This was long ago a witty author's lamentation, but the evil
still continues; and if a man of any delicacy were to attend the
discourses of the young fellows of this age, he would believe there
were none but the fallen to make the objects of passion. So true
it is what the author of the above verses said, a little before his
death, of the modern pretenders to gallantry: "They set up for
wits in this age, by saying, when they are sober, what they of the
last spoke only when they were drunk." But Cupid is not only
blind at present, but dead drunk; and he has lost all his faculties;
else how should Celia be so long a maid, with that agreeable behaviour?
Corinna, with that sprightly wit? Serbia, with that
heavenly voice? and Sacharissa, with all those excellences in one
person, frequent the park, the play, and murder the poor Tits that
drag her to public places, and not a man turn pale at her appearance?
But such is the fallen state of love, that if it were not for
honest Cynthio, who is true to the cause, we should hardly have
a pattern left of the ancient worthies in that way; and indeed he
has but very little encouragement to persevere. Though Cynthio
has wit, good sense, fortune, and his very being depends upon her,
the termagant for whom he sighs is in love with a fellow who stares
in the glass all the time he is with her, and lets her plainly see she
may possibly be his rival, but never his mistress. Yet Cynthio
pleases himself with a vain imagination that, with the language of
his eyes, now he has found out who she is, he shall conquer her,
though her eyes are intent upon one who looks from her, which is
ordinary with the sex.</p>

<p>'It is certainly a mistake in the ancients to draw the little gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Love as a blind boy, for his real character is a little thief
that squints; for ask Mrs. Meddle, who is a confidante or spy
upon all the passions in town, and she will tell you that the whole
is a game of cross purposes. The lover is generally pursuing one
who is in pursuit of another, and running from
one that desires to meet him. Nay, the nature
of this passion is so justly represented in a
squinting little thief (who is always in a double
action), that do but observe Clarissa next time
you see her, and you will find, when her eyes
have made their soft tour round the company
she makes no stay on him they say she is to
marry, but rests two seconds of a minute on
Wildair, who neither looks nor thinks on her or
any woman else. However, Cynthio had a bow from her the
other day, upon which he is very much come to himself; and I
heard him send his man of an errand yesterday, without any
manner of hesitation; a quarter of an hour after which he
reckoned twenty, remembered he was to sup with a friend, and
went exactly to his appointment. I sent to know how he did this
morning, and I find he hath not forgotten that he spoke to me
yesterday.'</p>

<p class="center p2">No. 9. <span class="smcap">The 'Tatler.'</span>&mdash;<i>April 30, 1709</i>.</p>

<p>Pastorella, a lively young lady of eighteen, was under the
charge of an aunt, who was anxious to keep her ward in safety, if
possible, from herself and her admirers. 'At the same time the
good lady knew, by long experience, that a gay inclination curbed
too rashly would but run to the greater excesses; she therefore
made use of an ingenious expedient to avoid the anguish of an
admonition. You are to know, then, that Miss, with all her
flirting and ogling, had also a strong curiosity in her, and was the
greatest eaves-dropper breathing. Parisatis (for so her prudent
aunt is called) observed this humour, and retires one day to her
closet, into which she knew Pastorella would peep and listen to
know how she was employed. It happened accordingly; and the
young lady saw her good governante on her knees, and, after a
<i>mental behaviour</i>, break into these words: "As for the dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
child committed to my care, let her sobriety of carriage and
severity of behaviour be such as may make that noble lord, who is
taken with her beauty, turn his designs to such as
are honourable." Here Parisatis heard her niece
nestle closer to the key-hole. She then goes on:
"Make her the joyful mother of a numerous and
wealthy offspring; and let her carriage be such as
may make this noble youth expect the blessings of
a happy marriage, from the singularity of her life, in
this loose and censorious age." Miss, having heard
enough, sneaks off for fear of discovery, and immediately
at her glass, alters the setting of her head;
then pulls up her tucker, and forms herself into the
exact manner of Lindamira; in a word, becomes a sincere convert
to everything that is commendable in a fine young lady; and two
or three such matches as her aunt feigned in her devotions are at
this day in her choice. This is the history and original cause of
Pastorella's conversion from coquetry.</p>

<p>'I scarce remember a greater instance of forbearance in the
usual peevish way with which the aged treat the young than this,
except that of our famous Noy, whose good nature went so far as
to make him put off his admonitions to his son even until after his
death; and did not give him his thoughts of him until he came to
read that memorable passage in his will: "All the rest of my estate,"
says he, "I leave to my son Edward, to be squandered as he shall
think fit; I leave it him for that purpose, and hope no better from
him." A generous disdain, and reflection how little he deserved
from so excellent a father, reformed the young man, and made
Edward, from an arrant rake, become a fine gentleman.'</p>

<p>The 'Tatler' relates the instance of a lady who had governed
one husband by falling into fits when he opposed her will. Death
released this gentleman, and the lady consoled herself quickly
with a very agreeable successor, whom she determined to manage
by the same method. 'This man knew her little arts, and resolved
to break through all tenderness, and be absolute master as soon as
occasion offered. One day it happened that a discourse arose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
about furniture; he was very glad of the occasion, and fell into an
invective against china, protesting that he would never let five
pounds more of his money be laid out that way as long as he
breathed. She immediately fainted&mdash;he starts up, as amazed, and
calls for help&mdash;the maids run up to the closet. He chafes her
face, bends her forward, and beats the palms of her hands; her
convulsions increase, and down she tumbles on the floor, where
she lies quite dead, in spite of what the whole family, from the
nursery to the kitchen, could do for her relief. The kind man
doubles his care, helps the servants to throw water into her face
by full quarts; and when the sinking part of the fit came again,
"Well, my dear," says he, "I applaud your action; but none of
your artifices; you are quite in other hands than those you passed
these pretty passions upon. I must take leave of you until you
are more sincere with me: farewell for ever." He was scarce at
the stair-head when she followed, and thanked him for her cure,
which was so absolute that she gave me this relation herself, to be
communicated for the benefit of all the voluntary invalids of her
sex.'</p>

converse at Wapping. They have merited already, on the waterside,
particular titles: the first is called Hogshead; the second,
Culverin; and the third, Musquet. This fraternity is preparing
for our end of the town, by their
ability in the exercises of Bacchus,
and measure their time and merit
by liquid weight and power of
drinking. Hogshead is a prettier
fellow than Culverin, by two
quarts; and Culverin than Musquet,
by a full pint. It is to be
feared Hogshead is so often too
full, and Culverin overloaded, that Musquet will be the only lasting
very pretty fellow of the three.'</p>

affront or not? A youth, entering a certain coffee-house, with his
cane tied to his button, wearing red-heeled shoes, I thought of
your description, and could not forbear telling a friend of mine
next to me, "There enters a smart fellow." The gentleman
hearing it, had immediately a mind to pick a quarrel with me, and
desired satisfaction; at which I was more puzzled than at the

that had lost their lives on such occasions. The thing is referred

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff has been working certain wonderful effects by
prescribing his <i>circumspection-water</i>, which has cured Mrs. Spy of
rolling her eyes about in public places. Lady Petulant had made
use of it to cure her husband's jealousy, and Lady Gad has cured
a whole neighbourhood of detraction.</p>

<p>'The fame of these things,' continues the Censor-General,
'added to my being an old fellow, makes me extremely acceptable
to the fair sex. You would hardly believe me when I tell you
there is not a man in town so much their delight as myself. They
make no more of visiting me than going to Madam Depingle's;
there were two of them, namely, Dainia and Clidamira (I assure
you women of distinction), who came to see me this morning, in
their way to prayers; and being in a very diverting humour (as
innocence always makes people cheerful), they would needs have
me, according to the distinction of pretty and very pretty fellows,
inform them if I thought either of them had a title to the very
pretty among those of their own sex; and if I did, which was the
most deserving of the two?</p>

<p>'To put them to the trial, "Look ye," said I, "I must not
rashly give my judgment in matters of this importance; pray let
me see you dance; I play upon the kit." They immediately fell
back to the lower end of the room (you may be sure they curtsied
low enough to me), and began. Never were two in the world so
equally matched, and both scholars to my namesake Isaac.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>

Never was man in so dangerous a condition as myself, when they
began to expand their charms. "Oh! ladies, ladies," cried I; "not
half that air; you will fire the house!" Both smiled, for, by-the-bye,
there is no carrying a metaphor too far when a lady's charms are
spoken of. Somebody, I think, has called a fine woman dancing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
"a brandished torch of beauty." These rivals move with such an
agreeable freedom that you would believe their gesture was the
necessary effect of the music, and not the product of skill and
practice. Now Clidamira came on with a crowd of graces, and
demanded my judgment with so sweet an air&mdash;and she had no
sooner carried it, but Dainia made her utterly forgot, by a gentle
sinking and a rigadoon step. The contest held a full half hour;
and, I protest, I saw no manner of difference in their perfections
until they came up together and expected sentence. "Look ye,
ladies," said I, "I see no difference in the least in your performances;
but you, Clidamira, seem to be so well satisfied that I
should determine for you, that I must give it to Dainia, who
stands with so much diffidence and fear, after showing an equal
merit to what she pretends to. Therefore, Clidamira, you are a
pretty, but, Dainia, you are a very pretty lady; for," said I,
"beauty loses its force if not accompanied with modesty. She
that hath an humble opinion of herself, will have everybody's
applause, because she does not expect it; while the vain creature
loses approbation through too great a sense of deserving it."'</p>

<p>The 'Tatler' inserts a letter on termagant wives and sporting
tastes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left65">
'Epsom, June 28.</p>

<p>'It is now almost three weeks since what you writ about happened
in this place. The quarrel between my friends did not run
so high as I find your accounts have made it. You are to understand
that the persons concerned in this scene were Lady Autumn
and Lady Springly. Autumn is a person of good breeding,
formality, and a singular way practised in the last age; and Lady
Springly, a modern impertinent of our sex, who affects as improper
a familiarity as the other does distance. These heroines have
married two brothers, both knights. Springly is the spouse of
the elder, who is a baronet, and Autumn, being a rich widow, has
taken the younger, and her purse endowed him with an equal fortune,
and knighthood of the same order. This jumble of titles,
you need not doubt, has been an aching torment to Autumn, who
took place of the other on no pretence but her carelessness and
disregard of distinction. The secret occasion of envy broiled
long in the breast of Autumn; but no opportunity of contention
on that subject happening, kept all things quiet until the accident
of which you demand an account.</p>

<p>'It was given out among all the gay people of this place, that
on the ninth instant several damsels, swift of foot, were to run for
a suit of head-cloaths at the Old Wells. Lady Autumn, on this
occasion, invited Springly to go with her in her coach to see the
race. When they came to the place, where the Governor of
Epsom and all his court of citizens were assembled, as well as a
crowd of people of all orders, a brisk young fellow addressed himself
to the younger of the ladies, viz. Springly, and offers her his
services to conduct her into the music-room. Springly accepts
the compliment, and is led triumphantly through a bowing crowd,
while Autumn is left among the rabble, and has much ado to
get back into her coach; but she did it at last, and as it is
usual to see, by the horses, my lady's present disposition, she
orders John to whip furiously home to her husband; where, when
she enters, down she sits, began to unpin her hood, and lament
her foolish fond heart to marry into a family where she was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
little regarded. Lady Springly, an hour or two after, returns
from the Wells, and finds the whole company together. Down
she sat, and a profound silence ensued. You know a premeditated
quarrel usually begins and works up with the words <i>some
people</i>. The silence was broken by Lady Autumn, who began to
say, "There are some people who fancy, that if some people"&mdash;Springly
immediately takes her up, "There are some people who
fancy, if other people"&mdash;Autumn repartees, "People may give
themselves airs; but other people, perhaps, who make less ado,
may be, perhaps, as agreeable as people who set themselves out
more." All the other people at the table sat mute, while these
two people, who were quarrelling, went on with the use of the
word <i>people</i>, instancing the very accidents between them, as if they
kept only in distant hints. Therefore, says Autumn, reddening,
"There are some people will go abroad in other people's coaches,
and leave those with whom they went to shift for themselves; and
if, perhaps, those people have married the younger brother, yet,
perhaps, he may be beholden to those people for what he is."
Springly smartly answers, "People may bring so much ill humour
into a family, as people may repent their receiving their money,"
and goes on&mdash;"Everybody is not considerable enough to give her
uneasiness."</p>

<p>'Upon this Autumn comes up to her, and desired her to kiss
her, and never to see her again; which her sister refusing, my
lady gave her a box on the ear. Springly returns, "Ay, ay," said
she, "I knew well enough you meant me by your some people;"
and gives her another on the other side. To it they went, with
most masculine fury; each husband ran in. The wives immediately
fell upon their husbands, and tore periwigs and cravats.
The company interposed; when (according to the slip-knot of
matrimony, which makes them return to one another when anyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
puts in between) the ladies and their husbands fell upon all
the rest of the company; and, having beat all their friends and
relations out of the house, came to themselves time enough to
know there was no bearing the jest of the place after these adventures,
and therefore marched off the next day. It is said, the
governor has sent several joints of mutton, and has proposed
divers dishes, very exquisitely dressed, to bring them down again.
From his address and knowledge in roast and boiled, all our
hopes of the return of this good company depend.</p>

<p>The 'Tatler' is discoursing of country squires, with fox-hunting
tastes, and how in their rough music of the field they
outdo the best Italian singers for noise and volume. One of
these worthies is described on a visit in genteel society in town.
'Mr. Bellfrey being at a visit where I was, viz. at his cousin's
(Lady Dainty's), in Soho Square, was asked what entertainments
they had in the country. Now, Bellfrey is very ignorant, and
much a clown; but confident withal: in a word, he struck up a
fox-chase; Lady Dainty's dog, Mr. Sippet, as she calls him,
started, jumped out of his lady's lap, and fell a barking. Bellfrey
went on, and called all the neighbouring parishes into the square.
Never was woman in such confusion as that delicate lady; but
there was no stopping her kinsman. A roomful of ladies fell into
the most violent laughter; my lady looked as if she was shrieking;
Mr. Sippet, in the middle of the room, breaking his heart
with barking, but all of us unheard. As soon as Bellfrey became
silent, up gets my lady, and takes
him by the arm, to lead him off.
Bellfrey was in his boots. As she
was hurrying him away, his spurs
take hold of her petticoat; his
whip throws down a cabinet of
china: he cries, "What! are your
crocks rotten? are your petticoats ragged? A man cannot walk
in your house for trincums."'</p>

<p>The practice of duelling had been early discountenanced by
the 'Tatler.' An altercation after a stock-broking transaction was
settled in the fashion thus reported in its pages:&mdash;</p>

<p>'... However, having sold the bear, and words arising about
the delivery, the most noble major, according to method, abused
the other with the titles of rogue, villain, bear-skin man, and the
like. Whereupon satisfaction was demanded and accepted, and
forth they marched to a most spacious room
in the sheriff's house, where, having due regard
to what you have lately published, yet
not willing to put up with affronts without
satisfaction, they stripped and in decent
manner fought full fairly with their wrathful
hands. The combat lasted a quarter of an
hour; in which time victory was often doubtful, until the major,
finding his adversary obstinate, unwilling to give him further chastisement,
with most shrill voice cried out, "I am satisfied!
enough!" whereupon the combat ceased, and both were friends
immediately.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, I am extremely concerned for the lieutenant-general,
who by his overthrow and defeat is made a deplorable instance of
the fortune of war, and the vicissitudes of human
affairs. He, alas! has lost in Beech Lane and
Chiswell Street all the glory he lately gained in and
about Holborn and St. Giles's. The art of sub-dividing
first and dividing afterwards is new and
surprising; and according to this method the troops
are disposed in King's Head Court and Red Lion
Market, nor is the conduct of these leaders less
conspicuous in the choice of the ground or field
of battle. Happy was it that the greatest part of
the achievements of this day was to be performed near Grub

should impartially transmit them to posterity! but then it can
never be enough regretted that we are left in the dark as to the
name and title of that extraordinary hero who commanded the
divisions in Paul's Alley; especially because those divisions are
justly styled brave, and accordingly were to push the enemy along
Bunhill Row, and thereby occasion a general battle. But Pallas
appeared, in the form of a shower of rain, and prevented the

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff, having paid a visit to Oxford, has spent the
evening with some merry wits, and, after his custom, he relates
the adventures of the evening to furnish a paper for the

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-259.jpg" width="201" height="81" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'I am got hither safe, but never spent time with so little satisfaction
as this evening; for, you must know, I was five hours with
three merry and two honest fellows. The former sang catches
and the latter even died with laughing at the noise they made.
"Well," says Tom Bellfrey, "you scholars, Mr. Bickerstaff, are
the worst company in the world." "Ay," says his opposite, "you
are dull to-night; prythee,
be merry." With that I
huzzaed, and took a jump
across the table, then came
clever upon my legs, and
fell a laughing. "Let Mr.
Bickerstaff alone," says one of the honest fellows; "when he is in
a good humour, he is as good company as any man in England."
He had no sooner spoke, but I snatched his hat off his head, and
clapped it upon my own, and burst out a laughing again; upon
which we all fell a laughing for half an hour. One of the honest
fellows got behind me in the interim and hit me a sound slap on
the back; upon which he got the laugh out of my hands; and
it was such a twang on my shoulders, that I confess he was
much merrier than I. I was half angry, but resolved to keep
up the good humour of the company; and after hallooing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
loud as I could possibly, I drank off a bumper of claret that
made me stare again. "Nay," says one of the honest fellows,
"Mr. Isaac is in the right; there is no conversation in this:
what signifies jumping or hitting one another on the back? let
us drink about." We did so from seven of the clock until eleven;
and now I am come hither, and, after the manner of the wise
Pythagoras, began to reflect upon the passages of the day. I remember
nothing but that I am bruised to death; and as it is my
way to write down all the good things I have heard in the last
conversation, to furnish my paper, I can from this only tell you
my sufferings and my bangs.'</p>

<p>Aurengezebe, a modern Eastern potentate, is described as
amusing his later years by playing the grand Turk to the Sultanas
of Little Britain.</p>

<p>'There is,' proceeds the account, 'a street near Covent Garden
known by the name of Drury, which, before the days of Christianity,
was purchased by the Queen of Paphos, and is the only
part of Great Britain where the tenure of vassalage is still in
being.... This seraglio is disposed into convenient alleys and
apartments, and every house, from the cellar to the garret, inhabited
by nymphs of different orders.</p>

<p>'Here it is that, when Aurengezebe thinks fit to give loose to
dalliance, the purveyors prepare the entertainment; and what
makes it more august is, that every person concerned in the interlude
has his set part, and the prince sends beforehand word what
he designs to say, and directs also the
very answer which shall be made to him.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-260.jpg" width="137" height="97" alt="" />

<p>'The entertainment is introduced by
the matron of the temple; whereon an
unhappy nymph, who is to be supposed
just escaped from the hands of a ravisher,
with her tresses dishevelled, runs into
the room with a dagger in her hand, and falls before the emperor.</p>

<p>'"Pity, oh! pity, whoever thou art, an unhappy virgin, whom
one of thy train has robbed of her innocence; her innocence,
which was all her portion&mdash;or rather let me die like the memorable

<p>The 'Tatler' describes an incident of Sir Taffety Trippet, a
fortune-hunter, whose follies, according to Mr. Bickerstaff, are too
gross to give diversion; and whose vanity is
too stupid to let him be sensible that he is a
public offence.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-261.jpg" width="109" height="216" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'It happened that, when he first set up for
a fortune-hunter, he chose Tunbridge for the
scene of action, where were at that time two
sisters upon the same design. The knight
believed, of course, the elder must be the
better prize; and consequently makes all
sail that way. People that want sense do
always in an egregious manner want modesty,
which made our hero triumph in
making his amour as public as was possible.
The adored lady was no less vain of his
public addresses. An attorney with one
cause is not half so restless as a woman with one lover. Wherever
they met, they talked to each other aloud, chose each other
partner at balls, saluted at the most conspicuous part of the
service of the church, and practised, in honour of each other, all
the remarkable particularities which are usual for persons who
admire one another, and are contemptible to the rest of the world.
These two lovers seemed as much made for each other as Adam
and Eve, and all pronounced it a match of nature's own making;
but the night before the nuptials, so universally approved, the
younger sister, envious of the good fortune even of her sister, who
had been present at most of the interviews, and had an equal taste
for the charm of a fop, as there are a set of women made for that
order of men; the younger, I say, unable to see so rich a prize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
pass by her, discovered to Sir Taffety that a coquet air, much
tongue, and three suits was all the portion of his mistress. His
love vanished that moment; himself and equipage the next
morning.'</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Delamira resigns her Fan.</span></p>

<p>'When the beauteous Delamira had published her intention of
entering the bonds of matrimony, the matchless Virgulta, whose
charms had made no satires, thus besought her to confide the
secret of her triumphs:&mdash;</p>

<p>'"Delamira! you are now going into that state of life wherein
the use of your charms is wholly to be applied to the pleasing
only one man. That swimming air of your body, that jaunty
bearing of your head over one shoulder, and that inexpressible
beauty in your manner of playing your fan, must be lowered into
a more confined behaviour, to show that you would rather shun
than receive addresses for the future. Therefore, dear Delamira,
give me those excellences you leave off, and acquaint me with
your manner of charming; for I take the liberty of our friendship
to say, that when I consider my own stature, motion,
complexion, wit, or breeding, I cannot think
myself any way your inferior; yet do I go through
crowds without wounding a man, and all my
acquaintance marry round me while I live a virgin
masked, and I think unregarded."</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-262.jpg" width="78" height="103" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Delamira heard her with great attention, and,
with that dexterity which is natural to her, told
her that "all she had above the rest of her sex and contemporary
beauties was wholly owing to a fan (that was left her by her
mother, and had been long in the family), which whoever had in
possession and used with skill, should command the hearts of all
her beholders; and since," said she, smiling, "I have no more to
do with extending my conquests or triumphs, I will make you a
present of this inestimable rarity." Virgulta made her expressions
of the highest gratitude for so uncommon a confidence in her, and
desired she would "show her what was peculiar in the management
of that utensil, which rendered it of such general force when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
she was mistress of it." Delamira replied, "You see, madam,
Cupid is the principal figure painted on it; and the skill in playing
the fan is, in your several motions of it, to let him appear as
little as possible; for honourable lovers fly all endeavours to
ensnare them, and your Cupid must hide his bow and arrow,
or he will never be sure of his game. You observe," continued
she, "that in all public assemblies the sexes seem to separate
themselves, and draw up to attack each other with eye-shot: that
is the time when the fan, which is all the armour of a woman, is
of most use in our defence; for our minds are construed by the
waving of that little instrument, and our thoughts appear in composure
or agitation according to the motion of it."'</p>

<p>The 'Tatler' transcribes from La Bruyère an extract, which he
introduces as 'one of the most elegant pieces of raillery and
satire.' La Bruyère describes the French as if speaking of a people
not yet discovered, in the air and style of a traveller:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I have heard talk of a country where the old men are gallant,
polite, and civil; the young men, on the contrary, stubborn, wild,
without either manners or civility. Amongst these people, he is
sober who is never drunk with anything but wine; the too frequent
use of it having rendered it flat and insipid to them: they
endeavour by brandy, or other strong liquors, to quicken their
taste, already extinguished, and want nothing to complete their
debauches but to drink aqua-fortis. The women of that country
hasten the decay of their beauty by their artifices
to preserve it; they paint their cheeks, eye-brows,
and shoulders, which they lay open, together with
their breasts, arms, and ears, as if they were afraid
to hide those places which they think will please,
and never think they show enough of them.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-263.jpg" width="79" height="140" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'The physiognomies of the people of that
country are not at all neat, but confused and embarrassed
with a bundle of strange hair, which they
prefer before their natural; with this they weave
something to cover their heads, which descends half way down
their bodies, hides their features, and hinders you from knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
men by their faces. This nation has, besides this, their god and
their king.</p>

<p>'The grandees go every day, at a certain hour, to a temple
they call a church: at the upper end of that temple there stands
an altar consecrated to their god, where the priest celebrates some
mysteries which they call holy, sacred, and tremendous. The
great men make a vast circle at the foot of the altar, standing with
their backs to the priests and the holy mysteries, and their faces
erected towards their king, who is seen on his knees upon a
throne, and to whom they seem to direct the desires of their hearts,
and all their devotion. However, in this custom there is to be
remarked a sort of subordination; for the people appear adoring
their prince and their prince adoring God.'</p>

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff is musing on the degeneracy of the fair, and on
the changes which beauty has undergone since his youth.</p>

<p>'We have,' he argues, 'no such thing as a standard for good
breeding. I was the other day at my Lady Wealthy's, and asked
one of her daughters how she did. She answered, "She never
conversed with men." The same day I visited at my Lady Plantwell's,
and asked her daughter the same question. She answers,
"What is that to you, you old thief?" and gives me a slap on the
shoulders....</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p>'I will not answer for it, but it may be that I (like other old
fellows) have a fondness for the fashions and manners which prevailed
when I was young and in
fashion myself. But certain it is
that the taste of youth and beauty
is very much lowered. The fine
women they show me now-a-days
are at best but pretty girls to me
who have seen Sacharissa, when all
the world repeated the poems she
inspired; and Villaria (the Duchess
of Cleveland), when a youthful king was her subject. The <i>things</i>
you follow and make songs on now should be sent to knit, or sit
down to bobbins or bone-lace: they are indeed neat, and so are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
their sempstresses; they are pretty, and so are their handmaids.
But that graceful motion, that awful mien, and that winning
attraction, which grew upon them from the thoughts and conversations
they met with in my time, are now no more seen. They
tell me I am old: I am glad I am so, for I do not like your present
young ladies.'</p>

<p>The 'Tatler' proposes to work upon the post, to establish
a charitable society, from which there shall go every day
circular letters to all parts, within the bills of mortality, to tell
people of their faults in a friendly manner, whereby they may know
what the world thinks of them. An example follows, which had
been already sent, by way of experiment, without success:&mdash;</p>

<p>'"Madam,&mdash;Let me beg of you to take off the patches at the

of your face; except you would please to remove

may properly enough retain the three patches above

It is observed by all the charitable society, as an instruction in
their epistles, that they tell people of nothing but what is in their
power to mend. I shall give another instance of this way of
writing: two sisters in Essex Street are eternally gaping out of the
window, as if they knew not the value of time, or would call in
companions. Upon which I writ the following line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>'"Dear Creatures,&mdash;On the receipt of this, shut your casements."
</p>
</div>

<p>'But I went by yesterday, and found them still at the window.
What can a man do in this case, but go in and wrap himself up in
his own integrity, with satisfaction only in this melancholy truth,
that virtue is its own reward; and that if no one is the better for
his admonitions, yet he is himself the more virtuous, in that he
gave those advices?'</p>

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff's sister Jenny is going to be married. The
'Tatler' tells the following anecdote, as a warning 'to be above
trifles:'&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-266.jpg" width="238" height="109" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'This, dear Jenny, is the reason that the quarrel between Sir
Harry and his lady, which began about her squirrel, is irreconcilable.
Sir Harry was reading a grave author; she runs into his
study, and, in a playing humour, claps the squirrel upon the folio:
he threw the animal, in
a rage, on the floor; she
snatches it up again,
calls Sir Harry a sour
pedant, without good
nature or good manners.
This cast him
into such a rage, that
he threw down the table before him, kicked the book round the
room, then recollected himself: "Lord, madam," said he, "why
did you run into such expressions? I was," said he, "in the
highest delight with that author when you clapped your squirrel
upon my book;" and smiling, added upon recollection, "I have
a great respect for your favourite, and pray let us be all friends."
My lady was so far from accepting this apology, that she immediately
conceived a resolution to keep him under for ever, and, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
a serious air, replied, "There is no regard to be had to what a man
says who can fall into so indecent a rage and an abject submission
in the same moment, for which I absolutely despise you." Upon
which she rushed out of the room. Sir Harry stayed some minutes
behind, to think and command himself; after which he followed
her into her bed-chamber, where she was prostrate upon the bed,
tearing her hair, and naming twenty coxcombs who would have
used her otherwise. This provoked him to so high a degree that
he forbade nothing but beating her; and all the servants in the
family were at their several stations listening, whilst the best man
and woman, the best master and mistress, defamed each other in a
way that is not to be repeated even at Billingsgate. You know
this ended in an immediate separation: she longs to return home,
but knows not how to do it; and he invites her home every day.
Her husband requires no submission of her; but she thinks her
very return will argue she is to blame, which she is resolved to be
for ever, rather than acknowledge it.'</p>

any palpitations at their approach: but I was in very great concern
how I could adjust the ceremonial, and demean myself to all
these great men, who perhaps had not seen anything above themselves
for these twenty years last past. I am sure that is the case
of Sir Harry. Besides which, I was sensible that there was a great
point in adjusting my behaviour to the simple squire, so as to give
him satisfaction, and not disoblige the justice of the quorum.</p>

<p>'The hour of nine was come this morning, and I had no
sooner set chairs, by the steward's letter, and fixed my tea-equipage,
but I heard a knock at my door, which was opened, but
no one entered; after which followed a long silence, which was at
last broken by, "Sir, I beg your pardon; I think I know better:"
and another voice, "Nay, good Sir Giles&mdash;&mdash;" I looked out
from my window, and saw the good company all with their hats
off, and arms spread, offering the door to each other. After many
offers, they entered with much solemnity, in the order Mr. Thrifty
was so kind as to name them to me. But they had now got to
my chamber-door, and I saw my old friend Sir Harry enter. I
met him with all the respect due to so reverend a vegetable; for
you are to know that is my sense of a person who remains idle in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
the same place for half a century. I got him with great success
into his chair by the fire, without throwing down any of my cups.
The knight-bachelor told me, "he had a great respect for my
whole family, and would, with my leave, place himself next to Sir
Harry, at whose right hand he had sat at every quarter-sessions
these thirty years, unless he was sick." The steward in the rear
whispered the young templar, "That is true to my knowledge."
I had the misfortune, as they stood cheek by jole, to desire the
squire to sit down before the justice of the quorum, to the no
small satisfaction of the former, and the resentment of the latter.
But I saw my error too late, and got them as soon as I could into
their seats. "Well," said I, "gentlemen, after I have told you
how glad I am of this great honour, I am to desire you to drink a
dish of tea." They answered one and all, "that they never drank
tea of a morning." "Not drink tea of a morning?" said I, staring
round me. Upon which the pert jackanapes, Nic Doubt, tipped
me the wink, and put out his tongue at his grandfather. Here
followed a profound silence, when the steward, in his boots and
whip, proposed, "that we should adjourn to some public house,
where everybody might call for what they pleased, and enter upon
the business." We all stood up in an instant, and Sir Harry filed
off from the left, very discreetly, countermarching behind the
chairs towards the door. After him Sir Giles, in the same manner.
The simple squire made a sudden start to follow; but the justice
of the quorum whipped between upon the stand of the stairs. A
maid, going up with coals, made us halt, and put us into such confusion
that we stood all in a heap, without any visible possibility of
recovering our order; for the young jackanapes seemed to make a
jest of this matter, and had so contrived, by pressing in amongst
us, under pretence of making way, that his grandfather was got
into the middle, and he knew nobody was of quality to stir a step
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
until Sir Harry moved first. We were fixed in this perplexity for
some time, until we heard a very loud noise in the street; and Sir
Harry asking what it was, I, to make them move, said, "it was
fire." Upon this all ran down as fast as they could, without order
or ceremony, until we got into the street, where we drew up in
very good order, and filed down Sheer Lane; the impertinent
templar driving us before him as in a string, and pointing to his
acquaintance who passed by. When we came to Dick's coffee-house
we were at our old difficulty, and took up the street upon
the same ceremony. We proceeded through the entry, and were
so necessarily kept in order by the situation that we were now got
into the coffee-house itself; where, as soon as we arrived, we
repeated our civilities to each other: after which we marched up
to the high table, which has an ascent to it inclosed in the middle
of the room. The whole house was alarmed at this entry, made
up of persons of so much state and rusticity. Sir Harry called for
a mug of ale and "Dyer's Letter." The boy brought the ale in an
instant, but said, "they did not take in the letter." "No!" says
Sir Harry, "then take back your mug; we are like indeed to have
good liquor at this house!" Here the templar tipped me a
second wink, and, if I had not looked very grave upon him, I
found he was disposed to be very familiar with me. In short, I
observed, after a long pause, that the gentlemen did not care to
enter upon business until after their morning draught, for which
reason I called for a bottle of mum; and finding that had no effect
upon them, I ordered a second, and a third; after which Sir
Harry reached over to me, and told me in a low voice, "that place
was too public for business; but he would call upon me again to-morrow
morning at my own lodgings, and bring some more friends
with him."'</p>

<p>'I was this morning awakened by a sudden shake of the
house; and as soon as I had got a little out of my consternation,
I felt another, which was followed by two or three repetitions of
the same convulsion. I got up as fast as possible, girt on my rapier,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
and snatched up my hat, when my landlady came up to me, and
told me, "that the gentlewoman of the next house begged me to
step thither, for that a lodger that she had taken in was run mad;
and she desired my advice." I went immediately. Our neighbour
told us, "she had the day before let her
second floor to a very genteel youngish man,
who told her he kept extraordinary good
hours, and was generally at home most part
of the morning and evening at study; but
that this morning he had for an hour together
made this extravagant noise which we
then heard." I went up stairs with my hand
upon the hilt of my rapier, and approached
this new lodger's door. I looked in at the
key-hole, and there I saw a well-made man
look with great attention on a book, and on
a sudden jump into the air so high, that his
head almost touched the ceiling. He came
down safe on his right foot, and again flew
up, alighting on his left; then looked again
at his book, and, holding out his leg, put it
into such a quivering motion, that I thought
that he would have shaken it off. He used
the left after the same manner, when on a
sudden, to my great surprise, he stooped
himself incredibly low, and turned gently on
his toes. After this circular motion, he continued
bent in that humble posture for some
time looking on his book. After this, he recovered
himself with a sudden spring, and
flew round the room in all the violence and
disorder imaginable, until he made a full pause
for want of breath. In this interim my woman
asked "what I thought?" I whispered "that
I thought this learned person an enthusiast, who possibly had his
education in the Peripatetic way, which was a sect of philosophers,
who always studied when walking." Observing him much out of
breath, I thought it the best time to master him if he were disordered,
and knocked at his door. I was surprised to find him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
open it, and say with great civility and good mien, "that he hoped
he had not disturbed us." I believed him in a lucid interval, and
desired "he would please to let me see his book." He did so,
smiling. I could not make anything of it, and, therefore, asked
"in what language it was writ?" He said, "it was one he studied
with great application; but it was his profession to teach it, and
could not communicate his knowledge without a consideration." I
answered that I hoped he would hereafter keep his thoughts to himself,
for his meditations this morning had cost me three coffee dishes
and a clean pipe. He seemed concerned at that, and told me "he
was a dancing master, and had been reading a dance or two before
he went out, which had been written by one who taught at an
academy in France." He observed me at a stand, and informed
me, "that now articulate motions as well as sounds were expressed
by proper characters; and that there is nothing so common as to
communicate a dance by a letter." I besought him hereafter to
meditate in a ground room, for that otherwise it would be impossible
for an artist of any other kind to live near him, and that I
was sure several of his thoughts this morning would have shaken
my spectacles off my nose, had I been myself at study.'</p>

<p>One of the celebrated beauties of 1709 pays the 'Tatler' a
friendly visit to obtain his counsel on the choice of her future

<p class="left65">
'From my own Apartment, November 7.</p>

<p>'I was very much surprised this evening with a visit from one
of the top Toasts of the
town, who came privately
in a chair, and bolted
into my room, while I
was reading a chapter of
Agrippa upon the occult
sciences; but, as she entered
with all the air and
bloom that nature ever bestowed on woman, I threw down the
conjurer and met the charmer. I had no sooner placed her at my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
right hand by the fire, but she opened to me the reason of her visit.
"Mr. Bickerstaff," said the fine creature, "I have been your correspondent
some time, though I never saw you before; I have writ
by the name of Maria. You have told me you are too far gone in
life to think of love. Therefore I am answered as to the passion
I spoke of; and," continued she, smiling, "I will not stay until
you grow young again, as you men never fail to do in your dotage;
but am come to consult you as to disposing of myself to another.
My person you see, my fortune is very considerable; but I am at
present under much perplexity how to act in a great conjuncture. I
have two lovers, Crassus and Lorio. Crassus is prodigiously rich,
but has no one distinguishing quality. Lorio has travelled, is well
bred, pleasant in discourse, discreet in his conduct, agreeable in
his person; and with all this, he has a competency of fortune
without superfluity. When I consider Lorio, my mind is filled
with an idea of the great satisfactions of a pleasant conversation.
When I think of Crassus, my equipage, numerous servants, gay
liveries, and various dresses, are opposed to the charms of his
rival. In a word, when I cast my eyes upon Lorio, I forget and
despise fortune; when I behold Crassus, I think only of pleasing
my vanity, and enjoying an uncontrolled expense in all the pleasures
of life, except love."'</p>

<p>The 'Tatler' naturally advised the lady that the man of her
affections, rather than the lover who could gratify her vanity with
outward show, would afford her the truest happiness, and counselled
her to keep her thoughts of happiness within the means
of her fortune, and not to measure it by comparison with the mere
riches of others.</p>

<p>'I have several hints and advertisements from unknown hands,
that some who are enemies to my labours design to demand the
fashionable way of satisfaction for the disturbance my lucubrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
have given them. I confess that as things now stand I do not
know how to deny such inviters, and am preparing myself accordingly.
I have bought pumps, and foils, and am every morning
practising in my chamber. My neighbour, the dancing-master,
has demanded of me, "why I take this liberty since I will not
allow it to him?" but I answered, "his was an act of indifferent
nature, and mine of necessity." My late treatises against duels
have so far disobliged the fraternity of the noble science of defence,
that I can get none of them to show me so much as one pass. I
am, therefore, obliged to learn by book, and have accordingly
several volumes, wherein all the postures are exactly delineated.
I must confess I am shy of letting people see me at this exercise,
because of my flannel waistcoat, and my spectacles, which I
am forced to fix on the better to observe the posture of the
enemy.</p>

<p>'I have upon my chamber walls drawn at full length the
figures of all sorts of men, from eight feet to three feet two inches.
Within this height, I take it, that all the fighting men of Great
Britain are comprehended. But as I push, I make allowance for
my being of a lank and spare body, and have chalked out in every
figure my own dimensions; for I scorn to rob any man of his life
by taking advantage of his breadth; therefore, I press purely in a
line down from his nose, and take no more of him to assault than
he has of me; for, to speak impartially, if a lean fellow wounds
a fat one in any part to the right or left, whether it be in <i>carte</i> or in
<i>tierce</i>, beyond the dimensions of the said lean fellow's own breadth,
I take it to be murder, and such a murder as is below a gentleman
to commit. As I am spare, I am also very tall, and behave
myself with relation to that advantage with the same punctilio,
and I am ready to stoop or stand, according to the stature of my
adversary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p>'I must confess that I have had great success this morning,
and have hit every figure round the room in a mortal part, without
receiving the least hurt, except a little scratch by falling on my
face, in pushing at one at the lower end of my chamber; but I
recovered so quick, and jumped so nimbly on my guard, that, if he
had been alive, he could not have hurt me. It is confessed I
have written against duels with some warmth; but in all my discourses
I have not ever said that I knew how a gentleman could
avoid a duel if he were provoked to it; and since that custom is
now become a law, I know nothing but the legislative power, with
new animadversions upon it, can put us in a capacity of denying
challenges, though we were afterwards hanged for it. But no more
of this at present. As things stand, I shall put up with no more
affronts; and I shall be so far from taking ill words that I will not
take ill looks. I therefore warn all hot young fellows not to look
hereafter more terrible than their neighbours; for if they stare at
me with their hats cocked higher than other people, I will not bear
it. Nay, I give warning to all people in general to look kindly at
me; for I will bear no frowns, even from ladies; and if any
woman pretends to look scornfully at me, I shall demand satisfaction
of the next of kin of the masculine gender.'</p>

effect, he changes his batteries. I am forced at present to take
this method; and instead of continuing to write against the singularity
some are guilty of in their habit and behaviour, I shall
henceforth desire them to persevere in it; and not only so, but
shall take it as a favour of all the coxcombs in the town, if they
will set marks upon themselves, and by some particular in their
dress show to what class they belong. It would be very obliging
in all such persons, who feel in themselves that they are not of
sound understanding, to give the world notice of it, and spare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
mankind the pains of finding them out. A cane upon the fifth
button shall from henceforth be the sign of a dapper; red-heeled
shoes and a hat hung upon one side of the head shall signify a
smart; <i>a good periwig made into a twist, with a brisk cock</i>, shall
speak a mettled fellow; and an upper lip covered
with snuff, a coffee-house statesman. But as it is
required that all coxcombs hang out their signs, it is,
on the other hand, expected that men of real merit
should avoid anything particular in their dress, gait,
or behaviour. For, as we old men delight in proverbs,
I cannot forbear bringing out one on this occasion,
that "good wine needs no bush."</p>

<p>'I must not leave this subject without reflecting
on several persons I have lately met, who at a distance
seem very terrible; but upon a stricter enquiry into their
looks and features, appear as meek and harmless as any of my
neighbours. These are country gentlemen, who of late years have
taken up a humour of coming to town in red coats, whom an
arch wag of my acquaintance used to describe very well by calling
them "sheep in wolves' clothing." I have often wondered that
honest gentlemen, who are good neighbours, and live quietly in
their own possessions, should take it into their heads to frighten
the town after this unreasonable manner. I shall think myself
obliged, if they persist in so unnatural a dress, notwithstanding
any posts they may have in the <i>militia</i>, to give away their red
coats to any of the soldiery who shall think fit to strip them, provided
the said soldiers can make it appear that they belong to a
regiment where there is a deficiency in the clothing. About two
days ago I was walking in the park, and accidentally met a rural
esquire, clothed in all the types above mentioned, with a carriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
and behaviour made entirely out of his own head. He was of a
bulk and stature larger than ordinary, had a red coat, flung open
to show a gay calamancho waistcoat. His periwig fell in a very
considerable bush upon each shoulder. His arms naturally swung
at an unreasonable distance from his sides; which, with the
advantage of a cane that he brandished in a great variety of
irregular motions, made it unsafe for any one to walk within
several yards of him. In this manner he took up the whole Mall,
his spectators moving on each side of it, whilst he cocked up his
hat, and marched directly for Westminster. I cannot tell who
this gentleman is, but for my comfort may say, with the lover in
Terence, who lost sight of a fine young lady, "Wherever thou art,
thou canst not be long concealed."'</p>

<p>The 'Tatler,' pursuing his vocation as a censor of manners, is
presumed to have established a court, before which all bearers of
canes, snuff-boxes, perfumed handkerchiefs, perspective glasses,
&amp;c., are brought, that they may, upon showing proper cause, have
licences granted for carrying the same; but upon conviction that
these appendages of fashion are adopted merely out of frivolous
show, the articles thus exposed are ordered to become forfeited.</p>

<p>'Having despatched this set of my petitioners, the bearers of
canes, there came in a well-dressed man, with a glass tube in one
hand, and his petition in the other. Upon his entering the room,
he <i>threw back the right side of his wig</i>, put forward his left leg,
and advancing the glass to his right eye, aimed it directly at me.
In the meanwhile, to make my observations also, I put on my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
spectacles; in which posture we surveyed each other for some
time. Upon the removal of our glasses, I desired him to read his
petition, which he did very promptly and easily; though at the
same time it sets forth "that he could see nothing distinctly, and
was within very few degrees of being utterly blind," concluding,
with a prayer, "that he might be permitted to strengthen his sight
by a glass." In answer to this, I told him "he might sometimes
extend it to his own destruction. As you are now," said I, "you
are out of the reach of beauty; the shafts of the finest eyes lose
their force before they can come at you; you cannot distinguish a
Toast from an orange-wench; you can see a whole circle of beauty
without any interruption from an impertinent face to discompose
you. In short, what are snares for others"&mdash;my petitioner would
hear no more, but told me very seriously, "Mr. Bickerstaff, you
quite mistake your man; it is the joy, the pleasure, the employment
of my life to frequent public assemblies and gaze upon the
fair." In a word, I found his use of a glass was occasioned by no
other infirmity but his vanity, and was not so much designed to
make him see as to make him be seen and distinguished by
others. I therefore refused him a licence for a perspective, but
allowed him a pair of spectacles, with full permission to use them
in any public assembly as he should think fit. He was followed
by so very few of this order of men, that I have reason to hope
that this sort of cheat is almost at an end.</p>

<p>'Little follies in dress and behaviour lead to greater evils.
The bearing to be laughed at for such singularity teaches us
insensibly an impertinent fortitude, and enables us to bear public
censure for things that most substantially deserve it. By this
means they open a gate to folly, and often render a man so ridiculous
as to discredit his virtues and capacities, and unqualify him
from doing any good in the world. Besides, the giving in to uncommon
habits of this nature, it is a want of that humble deference
which is due to mankind, and, what is worst of all, the certain
indication of some secret flaw in the mind of the person that
commits them.</p>

<p>'When I was a young man, I remember a gentleman of great
integrity and worth was very remarkable for wearing a broad belt
and a hanger instead of a fashionable sword, though in other
points a very well-bred man. I suspected him at first sight to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
have something wrong in him, but was not able for a long time to
discover any collateral proofs of it. I watched him narrowly for
six-and-thirty years, when at last, to the surprise of everybody but
myself, who had long expected to see the folly break out, he
married his own cook-maid.'</p>

<p>'There has not some years been such a tumult in our neighbourhood
as this evening, about six. At the lower end of the
lane, the word was given that there was a great funeral coming by.
The next moment came forward, in a very hasty instead of a
solemn manner, a long train of lights, when at last a footman, in
very high youth and health, with all his force, ran through the
whole art of beating the door of the house next to me, and ended
his rattle with the true finishing rap. This did not only bring one
to the door at which he knocked, but to that of everyone in the
lane in an instant. Among the rest, my country-maid took the
alarm, and immediately running to me, told me "there was a fine,
fine lady, who had three men with burial torches making way

the prettiest that ever was." The girl was going on in her story,
when the lady was come to my door in her chair, having mistaken
the house. As soon as she entered I saw she was Mr. Isaac's
scholar, by her speaking air, and the becoming stop she made
when she began her apology. "You will be surprised, sir," said
she, "that I take this liberty, who am utterly a stranger to you;
besides that, it may be thought an indecorum that I visit a man."
She made here a pretty hesitation, and held her fan to her face.
Then, as if recovering her resolution, she proceeded, "But I think
you have said, that men of your age are of no sex; therefore, I
may be as free with you as with one of my own."'</p>

then describes to him the honour he should esteem her visit; the

taking her miles round; several acquaintances on her visiting
list having been punctually called on every week, and yet
never seen for more than a year. Then follows an account of a

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff is meditating on mental infirmities; after examining
the faults of others, he is disposed to philosophise on his
own bad propensities, and his cautiousness to keep them within
reasonable subjection.</p>

<p>'I have somewhere either read or heard a very memorable
sentence, "that a man would be a most insupportable monster,
should he have the faults that are incident to his years, constitution,
profession, family, religion, age, and country;" and yet
every man is in danger of them all. For this reason, as I am an
old man, I take particular care to avoid being covetous, and telling
long stories. As I am choleric, I forbear not only swearing,
but all interjections of fretting, as pugh! or pish! and the like.
As I am a lay-man, I resolve not to conceive an aversion for a
wise and good man, because his
coat is of a different colour from
mine. As I am descended of
the ancient family of the Bickerstaffs,
I never call a man of
merit an upstart. As a Protestant,
I do not suffer my zeal
so far to transport me as to
name the Pope and the Devil
together. As I am fallen into
this degenerate age, I guard myself
particularly against the folly
I have now been speaking of. As I am an Englishman, I am
very cautious not to hate a stranger, or despise a poor palatine.'</p>

<p>The 'Tatler,' still maintaining his court for the examination of
frivolities in costume, is engaged in giving judgment on female
fashions. The hooped petticoat is the subject before his worshipful
board. A fair offender has been captured, and stripped of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
her encumbrances until she is reduced to dimensions which will
allow her to enter the house; the petticoat is then hung up to
the roof&mdash;its ample dimensions covering the entire court like a
canopy. The late wearer had the sense to confess that she 'should
be glad to see an example made of it, that she wore it for no
other reason but that she had a mind to look as big and burly as
other persons of her quality, and that she kept out of it as long as
she could and until she began to appear little in the eyes of her
acquaintance.' After hearing arguments concerning the encouragement
the wearing of these monstrous appendages offered to the
woollen manufacturers, to the rope and cord makers, and to the
whalebone fisheries of Greenland, the 'Tatler' pronounced his
decision that the expense thus entailed on fathers and husbands,
and the prejudice to the ladies themselves, 'who could never
expect to have any money in the pocket if they laid out so much
on the petticoat,' together with the fact that since the introduction
of these garments several persons of quality were in the habit of
cutting up their cast gowns to strengthen their stiffening, instead
of bestowing them as perquisites or in charity, determined him to
seize the petticoat as a forfeiture, to be sent as a present to a
widow gentlewoman, who had five daughters, to be made into
petticoats for each, the remainder to be returned to be cut up into
stomachers and caps, facings for waistcoat sleeves, and other garniture.
He thus concludes: 'I consider woman as a beautiful,
romantic animal, that may be adorned with furs and feathers,
pearls and diamonds, ores and
silks. The lynx shall cast its
skin at her feet to make her a
tippet; the peacock, parrot, and
swan shall pay contributions to
her muff; the sea shall be
searched for shells, and the
rocks for gems; and every part
of nature furnish out its share
towards the embellishment of a
creature that is the most consummate work of it. All this I shall
indulge them in; but as for the petticoat I have been speaking of
I neither can nor will allow it.'</p>

<p>'This paper was allotted for taking into consideration a late
request of two indulgent parents, touching the care of a young
daughter, whom they design to send to a boarding-school, or keep
at home, according to my determination; but I am diverted from
that subject by letters which I have received from several ladies,
complaining of a certain sect of professed enemies to the repose
of the fair sex, called oglers. These are, it seems, gentlemen who
look with deep attention on one object at the playhouses, and are
ever staring all round them in churches. It is urged by my correspondents,
that they do all
that is possible to keep their
eyes off these ensnarers; but
that, by what power they
know not, both their diversions
and devotions are interrupted
by them in such a manner as that they cannot
attend to either, without stealing
looks at the persons whose eyes are fixed upon them. By this
means, my petitioners say, they find themselves grow insensibly
less offended, and in time enamoured of these their enemies.
What is required of me on this occasion is, that as I love and
study to preserve the better part of mankind, the females, I would
give them some account of this dangerous way of assault; against
which there is so little defence, that it lays ambush for the sight
itself, and makes them seeingly, knowingly, willingly, and forcibly
go on to their own captivity. The naturalists tell us that the
rattlesnake will fix himself under a tree where he sees a squirrel
playing; and when he has once got the exchange of a glance
from the pretty wanton, will give it such a sudden stroke on its
imagination, that though it may play from bough to bough, and
strive to avert its eyes from it for some time, yet it comes nearer
and nearer, by little intervals looking another way, until it drops
into the jaws of the animal, which it knew gazed at it for no other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
reason but to ruin it. I did not believe this piece of philosophy
until the night when I made my observations of the play of eyes at
the opera, where I then saw the same thing pass between an ogler
and a coquette.'</p>

<p>'As I was sitting after dinner
in my elbow-chair, I took up
Homer, and dipped into that
famous speech of Achilles to
Priam,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
 in which he tells him
that Jupiter has by him two great
vessels, the one filled with blessings,
and the other with misfortunes;
out of which he mingles
a composition for every man that
comes into the world. This passage
so exceedingly pleased me, that, as I fell insensibly into my
afternoon's slumber, it wrought my imagination into the following
dream:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>'When Jupiter took into his hands the government of the
world, the several parts of nature with the presiding deities did
homage to him. One presented him with a mountain of winds,
another with a magazine of hail, and a third with a pile of thunderbolts.
The Stars offered up their influences; Ocean gave his
trident, Earth her fruits, and the Sun his seasons.</p>

<p>'Among others the Destinies advanced with two great urns,
one of which was fixed on the right hand of Jove's throne, and the
other on the left. The first was filled with all the blessings, the
second with all the calamities, of human life. Jupiter, in the
beginning of his reign, poured forth plentifully from the right
hand; but as mankind, degenerating, became unworthy of his
blessings, he broached the other vessel, which filled the earth
with pain and poverty, battles and distempers, jealousy and falsehood,
intoxicating pleasures and untimely deaths. He finally, in
despair at the depravity of human nature, resolved to recall his
gifts and lay them in store until the world should be inhabited by
a more deserving race.</p>

<p>'The three sisters of Destiny immediately repaired to the
earth in search of the several blessings which had been scattered
over it, but found great difficulties in their task. The first places
they resorted to, as the most likely of success, were cities, palaces,
and courts; but instead of meeting with what they looked for
here, they found nothing but envy, repining, uneasiness, and the
like bitter ingredients of the left-hand vessel; whereas, to their
great surprise, they discovered content, cheerfulness, health, innocence,
and other the most substantial blessings of life, in cottages,
shades, and solitudes. In other places the blessings had been
converted into calamities, and misfortunes had become real
benefits, while in many cases the two had entered into alliance. In
their perplexity the Destinies were compelled to throw all the blessings
and calamities into one vessel, and leave them to Jupiter to
use his own discretion in their future distribution.'</p>

<p>'I may, perhaps, be thought extravagant in my notion; but I
confess I am apt to impute the dishonours that sometimes happen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
in great families to the inflaming diet which is so much in fashion.
For this reason we see the florid complexion, the strong limb, and
the hale constitution are to be found among the meaner sort of
people, or in the wild gentry who have been educated among the
woods or mountains; whereas many great families are insensibly
fallen off from the athletic constitution of their progenitors, and are
dwindled away into a pale, sickly, spindle-legged generation of
valetudinarians.</p>

<p>'I look upon a French ragoût to be as pernicious to the
stomach as a glass of spirits; and when I see a young lady
swallow all the instigations of high soups, seasoned sauces, and
forced meats, I have wondered at the despair or tedious sighing
of her lovers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>'The rules among these false delicates are, to be as contradictory
as they can be to nature. They admit of nothing at their
tables in its natural form, or without some disguise. They are to
eat everything before it comes in season, and to leave it off as
soon as it is good to be eaten.</p>

<p>'I remember I was last summer invited to a friend's house,
who is a great admirer of the French cookery, and, as the phrase
is, "eats well." At our sitting down, I found the table covered
with a great variety of unknown dishes. I was mightily at a loss
to learn what they were, and therefore did not know where to help
myself. That which stood before me I took to be roasted porcupine&mdash;however,
I did not care for asking questions&mdash;and have since
been informed that it was only a larded turkey. I afterwards
passed my eye over several hashes, which I do not know the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
names of to this day; and, hearing that they were delicacies, did
not think fit to meddle with them. Among other dainties, I saw
something like a pheasant, and therefore desired to be helped to a
wing of it; but to my great surprise, my friend told me it was a
rabbit, which is a sort of meat I never cared for. Even the
dessert was so pleasingly devised and ingeniously arranged that I
cared not to displace it.</p>

<p>'As soon as this show was over, I took my leave, that I might
finish my dinner at my own house; for as I in everything love
what is simple and natural, so particularly my food. Two plain
dishes, with two or three good-natured, cheerful, ingenuous
friends, would make me more pleased and vain than all that
pomp and luxury can bestow; for it is my maxim that "he keeps
the greatest table who has the most valuable company at it."'</p>

<p>When he had lost all business of his own,</p>
<p>He ran in quest of news through all the town.</p>
</div></div>

<p>'There lived some years since, within my neighbourhood, a
very grave person, an upholsterer,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
 who seemed a man of more
than ordinary application to business. He was a very early riser,
and was often abroad two or three hours before any of his neighbours.
He had a particular carefulness in the knitting of his
brows, and a kind of impatience in all his motions, that plainly
discovered he was always intent upon matters of importance.
Upon my inquiry into his life and conversation, I found him to be
the greatest newsmonger in our quarter; that he rose before day
to read the "Postman;" and that he would take two or three
turns to the other end of the town before his neighbours were up,
to see if there were any Dutch mails come in. He had a wife and
several children; but was much more inquisitive to know what
passed in Poland than in his own family, and was in greater pain
and anxiety of mind for King Augustus's welfare than that of his
nearest relations. He looked extremely thin in a dearth of news,
and never enjoyed himself in a westerly wind. This indefatigable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
kind of life was the ruin of his shop; for, about the time that his
favourite prince left the crown of Poland, he broke and disappeared.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-289.jpg" width="368" height="145" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'This man and his affairs had been long out of my mind, until
about three days ago, as I was walking in St. James's Park, I
heard somebody at a distance hemming after me; and who should
it be but my old neighbour the upholsterer! I saw he was
reduced to extreme poverty, by certain shabby superfluities in his
dress; for notwithstanding that it was a very sultry day for the
time of the year, he wore a loose great-coat and a muff, with a
long campaign wig out of curl; to which he had added the ornament
of a pair of black garters buckled under the knee. Upon
his coming up to me, I was going to inquire into his present
circumstances; but I was prevented by his asking me, with a
whisper, "whether the last letters brought any accounts that one
might rely upon from Bender." I told him, "None that I heard
of;" and asked him "whether he had yet married his eldest
daughter." He told me, "No; but pray," says he, "tell me sincerely,
what are your thoughts of the King of Sweden?" For,
though his wife and children were starving, I found his chief concern
at present was for this great monarch. I told him "that I
looked upon him as one of the first heroes of the age." "But
pray," says he, "do you think there is any truth in the story of his
wound?" And finding me surprised at the question, "Nay," says
he, "I only propose it to you." I answered "that I thought
there was no reason to doubt of it." "But why in the heel," says
he, "more than in any other part of the body?" "Because,"
said I, "the bullet chanced to light there."</p>

<p>'We were now got to the upper end of the Mall, where were
three or four very odd fellows sitting together upon the bench.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
These I found were all of them politicians, who used to sun themselves
in that place every day about dinner-time. Observing them
to be curiosities in their kind, and my friend's acquaintance, I sat
down among them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-290.jpg" width="235" height="162" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'The chief politician of the bench was a great asserter of paradoxes.
He told us, with a seeming concern, "that, by some
news he had lately read from Muscovy, it appeared to him that
there was a storm gathering in the Black Sea, which might in time
do hurt to the naval forces of this nation." To this he added,
"that, for his part, he could not wish to see the Turk driven out
of Europe, which, he believed, could not but be prejudicial to our
woollen manufacture."</p>

<p>'He backed his assertions with so many broken hints and
such a show of depth and wisdom, that we gave ourselves up to
his opinions. The discourse at length fell upon a point which
seldom escapes a knot of true-born Englishmen; whether, in case
of a religious war, the Protestants would not be too strong for the
Papists. This we unanimously determined on the Protestant side.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
</p>

<p>'When we had fully discussed this point, my friend the upholsterer
began to exert himself upon the present negotiations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
peace; in which he deposed princes, settled the bounds of kingdoms,
and balanced the power of Europe, with great justice and
impartiality.</p>

<p>'I at length took my leave of the company, and was going
away; but had not gone thirty yards before the upholsterer
hemmed again after me. Upon his advancing towards me with a
whisper, I expected to hear some secret piece of news, which he
had not thought fit to communicate to the bench; but, instead of
that, he desired me in my ear to lend him half-a-crown. In compassion
to so needy a statesman, and to dissipate the confusion I
found he was in, I told him, "if he pleased, I would give him five
shillings, to receive five pounds of him when the great Turk was
driven out of Constantinople;" which he very readily accepted,
but not before he had laid down to me the impossibility of such
an event as the affairs of Europe now stand.</p>

<p>'I yesterday came hither about two hours before the company
generally make their appearance, with a design to read over all
the newspapers; but, upon my sitting down, I was accosted by
Ned Softly, who saw me from a corner in the other end of the
room, where I found he had been writing something. "Mr.
Bickerstaff," says he, "I observe, by a late paper of yours, that
you and I are just of a humour; for you must know, of all impertinences,
there is nothing which I so much hate as news. I never
read a gazette in my life; and never trouble my head about our
armies, whether they win or lose, or in what part of the world they
lie encamped." Without giving me time to reply, he drew a
paper of verses out of his pocket, telling me "that he had something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>

desire my judgment upon every line, for that we had time enough
before us until the company came in."</p>

<p>'Finding myself unavoidably engaged in such a conversation,
I was resolved to turn my pain into a pleasure and to divert
myself as well as I could with <i>so very odd</i> a fellow. "You must
understand," says Ned, "that the sonnet I am going to read to
you was written upon a lady, who showed me some verses of her
own making, and is, perhaps, the best <i>poet</i> of our age. But you
shall hear it."</p>

then the <i>dart</i> in the last line is certainly as pretty a sting on the
tail of an epigram, for so I think you critics call it, as ever entered
into the thought of a poet." "Dear Mr. Bickerstaff," says he,
shaking me by the hand, "everybody knows you to be a judge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
these things; and, to tell you truly, I read over Roscommon's

I sat down to write the sonnet which I have shown you. But
you shall hear it again, and pray observe every line of it; for not
one of them shall pass without your approbation. My friend
Dick Easy," continued he, "assured me he would rather have
written that '<i>Ah!</i>' than to have been the author of the 'Æneid.'</p>

<p>'"He indeed objected that I made Mira's pen like a quill in one
of the lines and like a dart in the other." "But as to that&mdash;oh!
as to that," says I, "it is but supposing Cupid to be like a porcupine,
and his quills and darts will be the same thing." He was
going to embrace me for the hint; but half-a-dozen critics coming
into the room, whose faces he did not like, he conveyed the

<p>'When we look into the delightful history of the most ingenious
Don Quixote of La Mancha, and consider the exercises and
manner of life of that renowned gentleman, we cannot
but admire the exquisite genius and discerning spirit
of Michael Cervantes; who has not only painted his
adventurer with great mastery in the conspicuous
parts of his story, which relate to love and honour,
but also intimated in his ordinary life, in his economy
and furniture, the infallible symptoms he gave of his
growing phrenzy, before he declared himself a knight-errant.
His hall was furnished with old lances, halberds,
and morions; his food, lentiles; his dress,
amorous. He slept moderately, rose early, and spent
his time in hunting. When by watchfulness and exercise he was
thus qualified for the hardships of his intended peregrinations, he
had nothing more to do but to fall hard to study; and, before he
should apply himself to the practical part, get into the methods of
making love and war by reading books of knighthood. As for
raising tender passions in him, Cervantes reports that he was wonderfully
delighted with a smooth intricate sentence; and when
they listened at his study-door, they could frequently hear him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
read aloud, "The reason of the unreasonableness, which against
my reason is wrought, doth so weaken my reason, as with all
reason I do justly complain of your beauty." Again he would
pause until he came to another charming sentence, and, with the
most pleasing accent imaginable, be loud at a new paragraph:
"The high heavens, which, with your divinity, do fortify you
divinely with the stars, make you deserveress of the deserts that
your greatness deserves." With these and other such passages,
says my author, the poor gentleman grew distracted, and was
breaking his brains day and night to understand and unravel their
sense.</p>

<p>'What I am now warning the people of is, that the newspapers
of this island are as pernicious to weak heads in England as ever
books of chivalry to Spain; and therefore shall do all that in me
lies, with the utmost care and vigilance imaginable, to prevent
these growing evils.'</p>

to suspend the enjoyment of it. He that cannot bear the sense of

<p>'Walking the other day in a neighbouring inn of court, I saw
a more happy and more graceful orator than I ever before had
heard or read of. A youth of about nineteen years of age was in
an Indian dressing-gown and laced cap, pleading a cause before
a glass. The young fellow had a very good air, and seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
hold his brief in his hand rather to help his action, than that he
wanted notes for his further information. When I first began to
observe him, I feared he would soon
be alarmed; but he was so zealous
for his client, and so favourably received
by the court, that he went on
with great fluency to inform the
bench that he humbly hoped they
would not let the merit of the cause
suffer by the youth and inexperience
of the pleader; that in all things he
submitted to their candour; and modestly desired they would not
conclude but that strength of argument and force of reason may
be consistent with grace of action and comeliness of person.</p>

another would have thought him; but I took part in his success,
and was very glad to find he had in his favour judgment and costs,
without any manner of opposition.'</p>

<p>'Were distinctions used according
to the rules of reason
and sense, those additions
to men's names would be,
as they were first intended,
significant of their worth, and
not their persons; so that in
some cases it might be proper to say of a deceased ambassador,
"The man is dead; but his excellency will never die." It is,
methinks, very unjust to laugh at a Quaker, because he has taken
up a resolution to treat you with a word the most expressive of
complaisance that can be thought of, and with an air of good-nature
and charity calls you <i>Friend</i>. I say, it is very unjust to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>

phrases of distinction, confound phrases of honour into no use at all.</p>

<p>'Tom Courtly, who is the pink of courtesy, is an instance of
how little moment an undistinguishing application of sounds of
honour are to those who understand themselves. Tom never fails
of paying his obeisance to every man he sees who has title or
office to make him conspicuous; but his deference is wholly given
to outward considerations. I, who know him, can tell him within
half an acre how much land one man has more than another by
Tom's bow to him. Title is all he knows of honour, and civility
of friendship; for this reason, because he cares for no man living,
he is religiously strict in performing, what he calls, his respects to
you. To this end he is very learned in pedigree, and will abate
something in the ceremony of his approaches to a man, if he is in
any doubt about the bearing of his coat of arms. What is the
most pleasant of all his character is, that he acts with a sort of
integrity in these impertinences; and though he would not do any
solid kindness, he is wonderfully just and careful not to wrong his
quality. But as integrity is very scarce in the world, I cannot
forbear having respect for the impertinent: it is some virtue to be
bound by anything. Tom and I are upon very good terms, for
the respect he has for the house of Bickerstaff. Though one
cannot but laugh at his serious consideration of things so little
essential, one must have a value even for a frivolous good conscience.'</p>

</div>

<p>The seventh volume of the 'Spectator,'
originally intended to be the last, was
concluded Dec. 6, 1712, and the first
paper of the 'Guardian' made its appearance
March 12, 1713. This work
had been actually projected by Steele
before the conclusion of the 'Spectator.'
In a letter to Pope, dated
Nov. 12, 1712, he thus announces his
intention: 'I desire you would let me
know whether you are at leisure or
not. I have a design which I shall
open in a month or two hence, with
the assistance of a few like yourself. If your thoughts are unengaged,
I shall explain myself further.'</p>

<p>It appears that Steele undertook this work without any previous
concert with his illustrious colleague, and that he pursued it for
many weeks with vigour and assiduity, and with very little assistance
from his friends or from the letter-box.</p>

<p>The views of our essayists in the choice of a name have been
either to select one that did not pledge them to any particular
plan, or one that expressed humility, or promised little, and might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
afterwards excite an agreeable surprise by its unexpected fertility.
Of the former class are the 'Spectator,' 'World,' 'Mirror;' of the
latter class are the 'Tatler,' 'Rambler,' 'Idler,' 'Adventurer,' &amp;c.
The 'Connoisseur' is a name of some danger, because of great
promise; and the 'Guardian' might perhaps have been liable to
the same objection, if 'Nestor Ironside' had not tempered the
austerity of the preceptor with the playfulness of the friend and
companion, and partaken of the amusements of his pupils while
he provided for their instruction. And with respect to his 'literary
speculations, as well as his merriment and burlesque,' we may
surely allow him some latitude, when we consider that the public
at large were put under his guardianship, and that the demand for
variety became consequently more extensive. The 'Guardian'&mdash;which
was in effect a continuation of the 'Spectator' under
another name&mdash;was published daily until Oct. 1, 1713, No. 175,
when it was abruptly closed by Steele, in consequence of a quarrel
between him and Tonson, the bookseller. Pope informs us that
Steele stood engaged to his publisher in articles of penalty for all
the 'Guardians;' and by desisting two days, and altering the title
of the paper, was quit of the obligation. Steele started the
'Englishman,' which was printed for Buckley, with a view of
carrying his politics into a new paper in which they might be in
place. Steele behaved vindictively to Tonson, and ruthlessly
destroyed the original publisher's legitimate rights of proprietorship
in the joint enterprise by advertising the 'Englishman' <i>as the
sequel</i> of the 'Guardian.'</p>

<p>In his first paper he likewise declared that he had 'for valuable
considerations purchased the lion<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
 (frequently alluded to in the
papers), desk, pen, ink, and paper, and all other goods of Nestor
Ironside, Esq., who had thought fit to write no more himself.'</p>

<p>Whatever stormy circumstances, declares Dr. Chalmers, attended
the conclusion, it appears that Steele came prepared for
the commencement of the 'Guardian,' with more industry and
richer stores than usual. He wrote a great many papers in succession,
with very little assistance from his contemporaries. Addison,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
for what reason is not very obvious, unless he was then looking to
higher employment, did not make his appearance until No. 67,
nor, with one exception, did he again contribute until No. 97,
when he proceeds without interruption for twenty-seven numbers,
during which time Steele's affairs are said to have been embarrassed.
Steele's share amounts to seventy-one papers, written in
his happiest vein. Addison wrote fifty-one papers, and generally
with his accustomed excellence; but it may perhaps be thought
that there is a greater proportion of serious matter, and more
frequent use made of the letter-box, than was usual with this
author.</p>

<p>The contributors to the 'Guardian' were not numerous. The
first for quality and value was the celebrated Bishop of Cloyne,
Dr. George Berkeley, a man so uniformly amiable as to be ranked
among the first of human beings; a writer sometimes so absurd
that it has been doubted whether it was possible he could be
serious in the principles he has laid down. His actions manifested
the warmest zeal for the interests of Christianity, while some of his
writings seemed intended to assist the cause of infidelity. The
respect of those who knew Dr. Berkeley, and his own excellent
character, have rescued his name from the imputations to which
his writings may have given occasion; and to posterity he will be
deservedly handed down as an able champion of religion, although
infected with an incurable love of paradox, and somewhat tainted
with the pride of philosophy, which his better sense could not
restrain.</p>

<p>Dr. Berkeley's share in the 'Guardian' has been ascertained,
partly on the authority of his son, who claimed Nos. 3, 27, 35, 39,
49, 55, 62, 70, 77, and 126, and partly on that of the annotators,
who added to these Nos. 83, 88, and 89.</p>

<p>It is asserted, on unquestionable authority, that Dr. Berkeley
had a guinea and a dinner with Steele for every paper he furnished.
This is the only circumstance that has come to light respecting
the payment received by the assistants in any of these works. In
the 'Spectator' it is probable that Addison and Steele were joint
sharers or proprietors. In the case of the 'Guardian,' as already
noticed, there was a contract between Steele and Tonson, the
nature of which has not been clearly explained.</p>

<p>Pope's share of the 'Guardian' can be traced with some degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
of certainty, and at least eight papers can be confidently assigned
to his pen, which entitle him to the very highest praise as an
essayist. These are Nos. 4, 11, 40, 61, 78, 91, 92, and 173.</p>

'Oxford, 1712.</p>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;I foresee that you will have many correspondents in this
place; but as I have often observed, with grief of heart, that
scholars are wretchedly ignorant in the science I profess, I flatter
myself that my letter will gain a place in your papers. I have
made it my study, sir, in these seats of learning, to look into the
nature of dress, and am what they call an <i>academical beau</i>. I have
often lamented that I am obliged to wear a grave habit, since by
that means I have not an opportunity to introduce fashions
amongst our young gentlemen; and so am forced, contrary to my
own inclinations, and the expectation of all who know me, to
appear in print. I have indeed met with some
success in the projects I have communicated to
some sparks with whom I am intimate, and I
cannot, without a secret triumph, confess that
the sleeves turned up with green velvet, which
now flourish throughout the university, sprung
originally from my invention.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-302.jpg" width="83" height="198" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'As it is necessary to have the head clear, as
well as the complexion, to be perfect in this part
of learning, I rarely mingle with the men (for I
abhor wine), but frequent the tea-tables of the
ladies. I know every part of their dress, and
can name all their things by their names. I
am consulted about every ornament they buy;
and, I speak it without vanity, have a very pretty fancy to knots
and the like. Sometimes I take a needle and spot a piece of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
muslin for pretty Patty Cross-stitch, who is my present favourite;
which, she says, I do neatly enough; or read one of your papers
and explain the motto, which they all like mightily. But then I
am a sort of petty tyrant among them, for I own I have my
humours. If anything be amiss, they are sure Mr. Sleek will find
fault; if any hoity-toighty things make a fuss, they are sure to be
taken to pieces the next visit. I am the dread of poor Celia,
whose wrapping gown is not right India; and am avoided by
Thalestris in her second-hand manteau, which several masters of
arts think very fine, whereas I discovered with half an eye that
it had been scoured.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>'Though every man cannot fill his head with learning, it is in
anyone's power to wear a pretty periwig; he who hath no knack
at writing sonnets, may however have a soft hand; and he may
arch his eye-brows, who hath not strength of genius for the
mathematics.</p>

<p>My next desire is, void of care and strife,</p>

<p>'Pastoral poetry not only amuses the fancy most delightfully,
but it is likewise more indebted to it than any other sort whatever.
It transports us into a kind of fairy-land, where our ears are
soothed with the melody of birds, bleating flocks and purling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
streams; our eyes are enchanted with flowery meadows and
springing greens; we are laid under cool shades, and entertained
with all the sweets and freshness of nature. It is a dream, it is a
vision, which may be real, and we believe that it is true.</p>

<p>'Another characteristic of a shepherd is simplicity of manners,
or innocence. This is so obvious that it would be but repetition
to insist long upon it. I shall only remind the reader, that as the
pastoral life is supposed to be where nature is not much depraved,
sincerity and truth will generally run through it. Some slight
transgressions, for the sake of variety, may be admitted, which in
effect will only serve to set off the simplicity of it in general. I
cannot better illustrate this rule than by the following example of
a swain who found his mistress asleep:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Once Delia slept, on easy moss reclined,</p>
<p>Her lovely limbs half bare, and rude the wind;</p>
<p>I smooth'd her coats, and stole a silent kiss;</p>
<p>Condemn me, shepherds, if I did amiss.</p>
</div></div>

<p>'A third sign of a swain is, that something of religion, and even
superstition, is part of his character. For we find that those who
have lived easy lives in the country, and contemplate the works of
nature, live in the greatest awe of their author; nor doth this
humour prevail less now than of old. Our peasants as sincerely
believe the tales of goblins and fairies as the heathens those of
fawns, nymphs, and satyrs. Hence we find the works of Virgil
and Theocritus sprinkled with left-handed ravens, blasted oaks,
witchcrafts, evil eyes, and the like. And I observe with great
pleasure, that our English author of the pastorals I have quoted
hath practised this secret with admirable judgment.'</p>

<p>Ride si sapis&mdash;<i>Mart. Epig.</i></p>
<p>Laugh if you're wise.</p>
</div></div>

<p>'In order to look into any person's temper I generally make
my first observation upon his laugh; whether he is easily moved,
and what are the passages which throw him into that agreeable
kind of convulsion. People are never so unguarded as when they
are pleased; and laughter being a visible symptom of some inward
satisfaction, it is then, if ever, we may believe the face. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
may be remarked in general under this head, that the laugh of
men of wit is, for the most part, but a faint, constrained kind of
half laugh, as such persons are never without some diffidence
about them; but that of fools is the most honest, natural, open
laugh in the world.</p>

<p>'As the playhouse affords us the most occasions of observing
upon the behaviour of the face, it may be useful (for the direction
of those who would be critics this way) to remark, that the virgin
ladies usually dispose themselves in front of the boxes; the young
married women compose the second row; while the rear is generally
made up of mothers of long standing, undesigning maids, and
contented widows. Whoever will cast his eye upon them under
this view, during the representation of a play, will find me so far
in the right that a <i>double entendre</i> strikes the first row into an
affected gravity, or careless indolence; the second will venture at
a smile; but the third take the conceit entirely, and express their
mirth in a downright laugh.</p>

<p>'When I descend to particulars, I find the reserved prude will
relapse into a smile at the extravagant freedoms of the coquette,
the coquette in her turn laughs at the starchness and awkward
affectation of the prude; the man of letters is tickled with the
vanity and ignorance of the fop, and the fop confesses his ridicule
at the unpoliteness of the pedant.</p>

<p>'I fancy we may range the several kinds of laughers under
the following heads:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Laughers">
<tr>
<td>The Dimplers,</td>
<td>The Laughers,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Smilers,</td>
<td>The Grinners,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" class="tdc">The Horse-laughers.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>'The Dimple is practised to give a grace to the features, and is
frequently made a bait to entangle a gazing lover. This was
called by the ancients the Chian laugh.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-305.jpg" width="282" height="82" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'The Smile is for the most part confined to the fair sex, and
their male retinue. It expresses our satisfaction in a silent sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
approbation, doth not too much disorder the features, and is
practised by lovers of the most delicate address. This tender
motion of the physiognomy the ancients called the Ionic laugh.</p>

<p>'The Laugh among us is the common <i>risus</i> of the ancients.</p>

<p>'The Grin, by writers of antiquity, is called the Syncrusian, and
was then, as it is at this time, made use of to display a beautiful
set of teeth.</p>

<p>'The Horse-laugh, or the Sardonic, is made use of with great
success in all kinds of disputation. The proficients in this kind,
by a well-timed laugh, will baffle the most solid argument. This
upon all occasions supplies the want of reason, is always received
with great applause in coffee-house disputes; and that side the
laugh joins with is generally observed to gain the better of his
antagonist.</p>

<p>'The prude hath a wonderful esteem for the Chian laugh, or
Dimple; she looks upon all the other kinds of laughter as excesses
of levity, and is never seen upon the most extravagant jests to disorder
her countenance with the ruffle of a smile. Her lips are
composed with a primness peculiar to her character; all her
modesty seems collected into her face, and she but very rarely
takes the freedom to sink her cheek into a dimple.</p>

<p>'The coquette is a proficient in laughter, and can run through
the whole exercise of the features. She subdues the formal lover
with the dimple, accosts the fop with the smile, joins with the wit
in the downright laugh; to vary the air of her countenance frequently
rallies with the grin; and when she has ridiculed her lover
quite out of his understanding, to complete his misfortune, strikes
him dumb with the horse-laugh.'</p>

at their afternoon tea, when the conversation ran upon fine gentlemen.
From the several characters that were given, and the
exceptions that were made, as this or that gentleman happened to
be named, I found that a lady is not difficult to be pleased, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
that the town swarms with fine gentlemen. A nimble pair of
heels, a smooth complexion, a full-bottomed wig, a laced shirt, an
embroidered suit, a pair of fringed gloves, a hat and feather, alike,
one and all, ennoble a man, and raise him above the vulgar in
female imagination.</p>

<p>'I could not forbear smiling at one of the prettiest and liveliest
of this gay assembly, who excepted to the gentility of Sir
William Hearty, because he wore a frieze coat, and breakfasted
upon toast and ale. I pretended to admire the fineness of her
taste, and to strike in with her in ridiculing those awkward healthy
gentlemen who seek to make nourishment the chief end of eating.
I gave her an account of an honest Yorkshire gentleman, who,
when I was a traveller, used to invite his acquaintances
at Paris to break their fast with him
upon cold roast beef and mum. There was,
I remember, a little French marquis, who was
often pleased to rally him unmercifully upon
beef and pudding, of which our countryman
would despatch a pound or two with great alacrity, while his antagonist
was picking at a mushroom or the haunch of a frog. I could
perceive the lady was pleased with what I said, and we parted very
good friends, by virtue of a maxim I always observe, never to contradict
or reason with a sprightly female. I went home, however,
full of a great many serious reflections upon what had passed; and
though in complaisance I disguised my sentiments, to keep up the
good humour of my fair companions, and to avoid being looked
upon as a testy old fellow; yet, out of the good-will I bear the
sex, and to prevent for the future their being imposed upon by
counterfeits, I shall give them the distinguishing marks of a true
fine gentleman.</p>

<p>This path conducts us to the Elysian fields.</p>
</div></div>

<p>'I have frequently observed in the walks belonging to all the
inns of court, a set of old fellows who appear to be humourists,
and wrapped up in themselves. I am very glad to observe that
these sages of this peripatetic sect study tranquillity and indolence
of body and mind in the neighbourhood of so much contention
as is carried on among the students of Littleton. Now
these, who are the jest of such as take themselves, and the world
usually takes to be in prosperity, are the very persons whose happiness,
were it understood, would be looked upon with burning
envy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>'I fell into the discovery of them in the following manner:
One day last summer, being particularly under the dominion of
the spleen, I resolved to soothe my melancholy in the company of
such, whose appearance promised a full return of any complaints I
could possibly utter. Living near Gray's Inn walks, I went
thither in search of the persons above described, and found some
of them seated upon a bench, where, as Milton sings&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>The unpierced shade imbrown'd their noontide bow'r.</p>
</div></div>

<p>'I squeezed in among them; and they did not only receive
my moanings with singular humanity, but gave me all possible
encouragement to enlarge them. If the blackness of my spleen
raised an imaginary distemper of body, some one of them immediately
sympathised with me. If I spake of any disappointment in
my fortune, another of them would abate my sorrowing by recounting
to me his own defeat upon the very same circumstances. If I
touched upon overlooked merit, the whole assembly seemed to
condole with me very feelingly upon that particular. In short, I
could not make myself so calamitous in mind, body, or circumstances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
but some one of them was upon a level with me. When
I had wound up my discourse, and was ripe for their intended
raillery, at first they crowned my narration with several piteous
sighs and groans; but after a short pause, and a signal given for
the onset, they burst out into a most incomprehensible fit of
laughter. You may be sure I was notably out of countenance,
which gave occasion to a second explosion of the same mirth.
What troubled me most was, that their figure, age, and short
sword preserved them from any imputation of cowardice upon
refusal of battle, and their number from insult. I had now no
other way to be upon good terms with them, but desiring I might
be admitted into this fraternity. This was at first vigorously
opposed, it being objected to me that I affected too much the
appearance of a happy man to be received into a society so proud
of appearing the most afflicted. However, as I only seemed to be
what they really were, I am admitted, by way of triumph, upon
probation for a year; and if within that time it shall be possible
for them to infuse any of their gaiety into me, I can, at Monmouth
Street, upon mighty easy terms, purchase the robes necessary for
my instalment into this order; and when they have made me as
happy, shall be willing to appear as miserable, as any of this
assembly.'</p>

<p>'There is nothing in which men deceive
themselves more ridiculously than in point
of reading, and which, as it is constantly
practised under the notion of improvement,
has less advantage.</p>

<p>'When I was sent to Oxford, my
chiefest expense ran upon books, and my
only expense upon numbers; so that you
may be sure I had what they call a choice
collection, sometimes buying by the pound,
sometimes by the dozen, at others by the hundred.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<p>'As I always held it necessary to read in public places, by way
of ostentation, but could not possibly travel with a library in my
pockets, I took the following method to gratify this errantry of
mine. I contrived a little pocket-book, each leaf of which was a
different author, so that my wandering was indulged and concealed
within the same enclosure.</p>

<p>'This extravagant humour, which should seem to pronounce
me irrecoverable, had the contrary effect; and my hand and eye
being thus confined to a single book, in a little time reconciled
me to the perusal of a single author. However, I chose such a
one as had as little connection as possible, turning to the Proverbs
of Solomon, where the best instructions are thrown together in the
most beautiful range imaginable, and where I found all that
variety which I had before sought in so many different authors,
and which was so necessary to beguile my attention. By these
proper degrees I have made so glorious a reformation in my
studies that I can keep company with Tully in his most extended
periods, and work through the continued narrations of the most
prolix historian. I now read nothing without making exact collections,
and shall shortly give the world an instance of this in the
publication of the following discourses. The first is a learned
controversy about the existence of griffins, in which I hope to convince
the world that notwithstanding such a mixed creature has
been allowed by Ælian, Solinus, Mela, and Herodotus, that they
have been perfectly mistaken in the matter, and shall support myself
by the authority of Albertus, Pliny, Aldrovandus, and Matthias
Michovius; which two last have clearly argued that animal out of
the creation.</p>

<p>'The second is a treatise of sternutation or sneezing, with the
original custom of saluting or blessing upon that motion; as also
with a problem from Aristotle, showing why sneezing from noon
to night was innocent enough; from night to noon, extremely
unfortunate.</p>

<p>'The third and most curious is my discourse upon the nature
of the lake Asphaltites, or the lake of Sodom; being a very careful
enquiry whether brickbats and iron will swim in that lake, and
feathers sink, as Pliny and Mandevil have averred.</p>

<p>'The discussing these difficulties without perplexity or prejudice,
the labour of collecting and collating matters of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
nature, will, I hope, in a great measure atone for the idle hours I
have trifled away in matters of less importance.'</p>

<p>'The same weakness, or defect in the mind, from whence
pedantry takes its rise, does likewise give birth to avarice. Words
and money are both to be regarded as only marks of things; and
as the knowledge of the one, so the possession of the other is of
no use, unless directed to a farther end. A mutual commerce
could not be carried on among men, if some common standard
had not been agreed upon, to which the value of all the various
productions of art and nature were reducible, and which might be
of the same use in the conveyance of property as words are in that
of ideas. Gold, by its beauty, scarceness, and durable nature,
seems designed by Providence to a purpose so excellent and
advantageous to mankind. Upon these considerations that metal
came first into esteem. But such who cannot see beyond what
is nearest in the pursuit, beholding mankind touched with an
affection for gold, and being ignorant of the true reason that
introduced this odd passion into human nature, imagine some
intrinsic worth in the metal to be the cause of it. Hence the
same men who, had they been turned towards learning, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
have employed themselves in laying up words in their memory,
are by a different application employed to as much purpose in
treasuring up gold in their coffers. They differ only in the object;
the principle on which they act, and the inward frame of mind, is
the same in the critic and the miser.'</p>

<p>'There is a silly habit among many of our minor orators, who
display their eloquence in the several coffee-houses of this fair
city, to the no small annoyance of considerable numbers of her
Majesty's spruce and loving subjects, and that is, a humour they
have got of twisting off your buttons. These
ingenious gentlemen are not able to advance
three words till they have got fast hold of one
of your buttons; but as soon as they have
procured such an excellent handle for discourse,
they will indeed proceed with great
elocution. I know not how well some may
have escaped; but for my part, I have often
met with them to my cost; having, I believe,
within these three years last past, been argued
out of several dozen; insomuch that I have for some time ordered
my tailor to bring me home with every suit a dozen at least of
spare ones, to supply the place of such as, from time to time, are
detached as a help to discourse, by the vehement gentlemen
before mentioned. In the coffee-houses here about the Temple,
you may harangue even among our dabblers in politics for about
two buttons a-day, and many times for less. I had yesterday the
good fortune to receive very considerable additions to my knowledge
in state affairs; and I find this morning that it has not stood
me in above a button. Besides the gentlemen before mentioned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
there are others who are no less active in their harangues, but with
gentle services rather than robberies. These, while they are improving
your understanding, are at the same time setting off your
person: they will new plait and adjust your neckcloth.</p>

<p>'I am of opinion that no orator or speaker in public or private
has any right to meddle with anybody's clothes but his own. I
indulge men in the liberty of playing with their own hats, fumbling
in their own pockets, settling their own periwigs, tossing or twisting
their heads, and all other gesticulations which may contribute to
their elocution, but pronounce it an infringement of the English
liberty, for a man to keep his neighbour's person in custody in
order to force a hearing; and farther declare, that all assent
given by an auditor under such constraint is of itself void and of
no effect.'</p>

is the most gallant lover of the age. He
is particularly nice in his habiliments;
and to the end justice may be done in
that way, constantly employs the same
artist who makes attire for the neighbouring
princes, and ladies of quality.
The vivacity of his temper inclines him
sometimes to boast of the favours of
the fair. He was the other night excusing
his absence from the club on account of an assignation with
a lady (and, as he had the vanity to tell us, a tall one too), but
one of the company, who was his confidant, assured us she was a
woman of humour, and consented she would permit him to kiss
her, but only on the condition that his toe must be tied to hers.'

<p>'There is a certain female ornament,
by some called a <i>tucker</i>, and
by others the <i>neckpiece</i>, being a slip
of fine linen or muslin, that used to
run in a small kind of ruffle round
the uppermost verge of the women's
stays, and by that means covered a
great part of the shoulders and
bosom. Having thus given a definition,
or rather description, of the
tucker, I must take notice, that our ladies have of late thrown
aside this fig-leaf, and exposed in its primitive nakedness that
gentle swelling of the breast which it was used to conceal.</p>

<p>'If we survey the pictures of our great-grandmothers in Queen
Elizabeth's time, we see them clothed down to the very wrists, and
up to the very chin. The hands and face were the only samples
they gave of their beautiful persons. The following age of females
made larger discoveries of their complexion. They first of all
tucked up their garments to the elbow; and, notwithstanding the
tenderness of the sex, were content, for the information of mankind,
to expose their arms to the coldness of the air, and injuries
of the weather. This artifice hath succeeded to their wishes, and
betrayed many to their arms, who might have escaped them had
they been still concealed.</p>

<p>'About the same time, the ladies considering that the neck
was a very modest part in a human body, they freed it from those
yokes, I mean those monstrous linen ruffs in which the simplicity
of their grandmothers had enclosed it. In proportion as the
age refined, the dress still sunk lower; so that when we now say
a woman has a handsome neck, we reckon into it many of the
adjacent parts. The disuse of the tucker has still enlarged it,
insomuch that the neck of a fine woman at present takes in almost
half the body.'

<p>'I think myself obliged to acquaint the public
that the lion's head, of which I advertised
them about a fortnight ago, is now erected
at Button's coffee-house, in Russell Street,
Covent Garden, where it opens its mouth
at all hours for the reception of such intelligence
as shall be thrown into it. It is
reckoned an excellent piece of workmanship,
and was designed by a great hand in
imitation of the antique Egyptian lion, the face of it being compounded
out of that of a lion and a wizard. The features are
strong and well furrowed. The whiskers are admired by all that
have seen them. It is planted on the western side of the coffee-house,
holding its paws under the chin upon a box, which contains
everything that he swallows. He is indeed a proper emblem of
knowledge and action, being all head and paws.</p>

<p>'I need not acquaint my readers that my lion, like a moth or
bookworm, feeds upon nothing but paper, and shall only beg of
them to diet him with wholesome and substantial food. I must
therefore desire that they will not gorge him either with nonsense
or obscenity; and must likewise insist that his mouth must not be
defiled with scandal, for I would not make use of him to revile the
human species, and satirise those who are his betters. I shall not
suffer him to worry any man's reputation; nor indeed fall on any
person whatsoever, such only excepted as disgrace the name of
this generous animal, and under the title of lions contrive the ruin
of their fellow-subjects. Those who read the history of the Popes,
observe that the Leos have been the best and the Innocents the
worst of that species; and I hope I shall not be thought to derogate
from my lion's character, by representing him as such a
peaceable, good-natured, well-designing beast.'

<p>'I have heard, with great satisfaction, that you have forbidden
your priests to confess any woman who appears before them
without a tucker; in which you please me well. I do agree with
you that it is impossible for a good man to discharge his office
as he ought, who gives an ear to those alluring penitents that
discover their hearts and necks to him at the same time. I am
labouring, as much as in me lies,
to stir up the same spirit of modesty
among the women of this

assist one another in so good a
work. In order to it, I desire that
you would send me over the length
of a Roman lady's neck, as it stood
before your late prohibition. We
have some here who have necks of
one, two, and three feet in length;
some that have necks which reach
down to their middles; and, indeed,
some who may be said to be all neck, and no body. I hope at
the same time you observe the stays of your female subjects, that
you have also an eye to their petticoats, which rise in this island
daily. When the petticoat reaches but to the knee, and the stays
fall to the fifth rib (which I hear is to be the standard of each
as it has been lately settled in a junto of the sex), I will take care to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
send you one of either sort, which I advertise you of beforehand,
that you may not compute the stature of our English women from
the length of their garments. In the meantime, I have desired
the master of a vessel, who tells me that he shall touch at Civita
Vecchia, to present you with a certain female machine, which I
believe will puzzle your infallibility to discover the use of it. Not
to keep you in suspense, it is what we call, in this country, a
hooped petticoat. I shall only beg of you to let me know whether
you find any garment of this nature among all the relics of your
female saints; and, in particular, whether it was ever worn by any
of your twenty thousand virgin martyrs.</p>

to beings of superior faculties it must be pride. They

the heart of man, and of those little supernumerary advantages,
whether of birth, fortune, or title, which one man enjoys above
another, that it must certainly very much astonish, if it does not
very much divert them, when they see a mortal puffed up, and
valuing himself above his neighbours on any of these accounts, at
the same time that he is obnoxious to all the common calamities
of the species.</p>

<p>'To set this thought in its true light, we will fancy, if you

and that every pismire (his shape and way of life only excepted)
is endowed with human passions. How should we smile to hear
one give us an account of the pedigrees, distinctions, and titles
that reign among them! Observe how the whole swarm divide
and make way for the pismire that passes through them! You
must understand he is an emmet of quality, and has better blood
in his veins than any pismire in the molehill. Do not you see
how sensible he is of it, how slow he marches forward, how the
whole rabble of ants keep their distance? Here you may observe

one placed upon a little eminence, and looking down on a long

he has a walk of half a yard in length, and a quarter of an inch in
breadth; he keeps a hundred menial servants, and has at least
fifteen barleycorns in his granary. He is now chiding and beslaving

purchase it. See how the ants of all qualities and conditions
swarm about him. Should this straw drop out of his mouth, you
would see all this numerous circle of attendants follow the next
that took it up, and leave the discarded insect, or run over his

<p>'"The name of Helim is still famous through all the Eastern
parts of the world. He was the Governor of the Black Palace, a
man of infinite wisdom, and chief of the physicians to Alnareschin,
the great King of Persia.</p>

<p>'"Alnareschin was the most dreadful tyrant that ever reigned
over that country. He was of a fearful, suspicious, and cruel nature,
having put to death, upon slight surmises, five-and-thirty of his
queens, and above twenty sons, whom he suspected of conspiring.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Being at length wearied with the exercise of so many cruelties,
and fearing the whole race of Caliphs would be extinguished, he
sent for Helim, the good physician, and confided his two remaining
sons, Ibrahim and Abdallah, then mere infants, to his charge,
requesting him to bring them up in virtuous retirement. Helim
had an only child, a girl of noble soul, and a most beautiful person.
Abdallah, whose mind was of a more tender turn than that of
Ibrahim, grew by degrees so enamoured of her conversation that
he did not think he lived unless in the company of his beloved
Balsora.</p>

<p>'"The fame of her beauty was so great that it came to the ears
of the king, who, pretending to visit the young princes, his sons,
demanded of Helim the sight of his fair daughter. The king was
so inflamed with her beauty and behaviour that he sent for Helim
the next morning, and told him it was now his design to recompense
him for all his faithful services, and that he intended to
make his daughter Queen of Persia.</p>

<p>'"Helim, who remembered the fate of the former queens, and
who was also acquainted with the secret love of Abdallah, contrived
to administer a sleeping draught to his daughter, and
announced to the king that the news of his intention had overcome
her. The king ordered that as he had designed to wed Balsora,
her body should be laid in the Black Palace among those of his
deceased queens.</p>

<p>'"Abdallah soon fretted after his love, and Helim administered
a similar potion to his ward, and he was laid in the same tomb.
Helim, having charge of the Black Palace, awaited their revival,
and then secretly supplied them with sustenance, and finally contrived,
by dressing them as spirits, to convey them away from
this sepulchre, and concealed them in a palace which had been
bestowed on him by the king in reward for his recovering him
from a dangerous illness.</p>

<p>'"About ten years after their abode in this place the old king
died. The new king, Ibrahim, being one day out hunting, and
separated from his company, found himself, almost fainting with
heat and thirst, at the foot of Mount Khacan, and, ascending the
hill, he arrived at Helim's house and requested refreshments.
Helim was, very luckily, there at that time, and after having set
before the king the choicest of wines and fruits, finding him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
wonderfully pleased with so seasonable a treat, told him that the
best part of his entertainment was to come; upon which he
opened to him the whole history of what had passed. The king
was at once astonished and transported at so strange a relation,
and seeing his brother enter the room with Balsora in his hand,
he leaped off from the sofa on which he sat, and cried out, ''Tis
he! 'tis my Abdallah!' Having said this, he fell upon his neck
and wept.</p>

<p>'"Ibrahim offered to divide his empire with his brother, but,
finding the lovers preferred their retirement, he made them a
present of all the open country as far as they could see from the
top of Mount Khacan, which Abdallah continued to improve and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
beautify until it became the most delicious spot of ground within
the empire, and it is, therefore, called the garden of Persia.</p>

<p>'"Ibrahim, after a long and happy reign, died without children,
and was succeeded by Abdallah, the son of Abdallah and
Balsora. This was that King Abdallah who afterwards fixed the
imperial residence upon Mount Khacan, which continues at this
time to be the favourite palace of the Persian Empire."'

<p>'As to the filling the paper with trifles and things of no significancy,
the instances of it are obvious and numerous. The French
king's losing a rotten tooth, and the surgeon's fee thereupon; a
duke's taking physic, and a magistrate's swearing a small oath, and
a poor thief's ravishing a knapsack, have all, in their turns, furnished
out deep matter for wit and eloquence to these vigilant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
writers, who hawk for adventures. A man of quality cannot steal
out of town for a day or two, or return to it, without the attendance
of a coach and six horses, and a news-writer, who makes
the important secret the burden of his paper next day. I have
observed, that if a man be but great or rich, the most wretched
occasion entitles him to fill a long paragraph in print; the cutting
of his corns for the purpose, or his playing at ombre, never fails to
merit publication. Now, if my <i>most diligent</i> brother-writers, who
are spies upon the actions and cabinets of the great, would go a
little farther, and tell us when his grace or his lordship broke his
custom by keeping his word, or said a witty thing, or did a generous
one, we will freely own they tell us some news, and will thank
them for our pleasure and our surprise.</p>

<p>'It is with concern, I see, that even the privacies of the poor
ladies cannot escape the eyes of these public searchers. How
many great ladies do they bring to bed every day of their lives!
for poor madam no sooner begins to make faces, and utter the
least groan, but instantly an author stands with his pen in his
teeth, ready to hold her back, and to tell the town whether the
baby is boy or girl, before the midwife has pulled off her spectacles,
and described its <i>nose</i>.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Of a Country Entertainment.</span></p>

<p>'I am led by the regard which I bear to the ladies and the
Christmas holidays to divert my readers with the history of an
entertainment, where I made one at the house of a country squire.</p>

<p>'When I went in I found the dining-room full of ladies, to
whom I made a profound bow, and was repaid by a whole circle
of curtsies. While I was meditating, with my eyes fixed upon
the fire, what I had best say, I could hear one of them whisper to
another, "I believe he thinks we smoke tobacco;" for, my reader
must know, I had omitted the country fashion, and not kissed one
of them.</p>

<p>'At dinner we had many excuses from the lady of the house
for <i>our indifferent fare</i>, and she had as many declarations from us,
her guests, that <i>all was very good</i>. And the squire gave us the
history and extraction of every fowl that came to the table. He
assured us that his poultry had neither kindred nor allies anywhere
on this side of the Channel.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-325.jpg" width="254" height="91" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'As soon as we were risen from the table, our great parliament
of females presently resolved themselves into committees of twos
and threes all over the dining-room, and I perceived that every
party was engaged in talking scandal.</p>

<p>'The ladies then went into one parlour to their tea, and we
men into another to our bottle, over which I was entertained with
many ingenious remarks on the price of barley, on dairies and the
sheepfold. But as the most engaging conversation is, when too
long, sometimes cloying, having smoked my pipe in due silence
and attention, I took a trip to the ladies, who had sent to know
whether I would drink some tea. When I made my entrance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
the topic they were on was religion, in their statements about
which they were terribly divided, and debated with such agitation
and fervour, that I grew in pain for the china cups.</p>

<p>'But they happily departed from this warm point, and unanimously
fell backbiting their neighbours, which instantly qualified
all their heat and heartily reconciled them to one another, insomuch
that all the time the business of scandal was handling there
was not one dissenting voice to be heard in the whole assembly.</p>

<p>'By this time the music was come, and happy was the woman
that could first wipe her mouth and be soonest upon her legs. In
the dance some moved very becomingly, but the majority made
such a rattle on the boards as quite drowned the music. This
made me call to mind your mettlesome horses, that dance on a
pavement to the music of their own heels.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-326.jpg" width="334" height="155" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'We had among us the squire's eldest son, a batchelor and
captain of the militia. This honest gentleman, believing, as one
would imagine, that good humour and wit consisted in activity of
body and thickness of bone, was resolved to be very witty, that is
to say, very strong; he therefore not only threw down most of the
women, and with abundance of wit hauled them round the room,
but gave us several farther proofs of the sprightliness of his genius,
by a great many leaps he made about a yard high, always remembering
to fall on somebody's toes. This ingenious fancy was
applauded by everyone, except the person who felt it, who never
happened to have complaisance enough to fall in with the general
laugh that was raised on that occasion. For my own part, who
am an occasional conformist to common custom, I was ashamed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
to be singular, so I even extended my mouth into a smile, and
put my face into a laughing posture too. His mother, observing
me to look pleased with her son's activity and gay deportment,
told me in my ear, "<i>he was never worse company than I saw him</i>."
To which I answered, "<i>I vow, madam, I believe you</i>."'</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Of the Spleen.</span></p>

<p>'In constitutions where this humorous distemper prevails, it
is surprising how trifling a matter will inflame it.</p>

<p>'I shall never forget an ingenious doctor of physick, who was so
jealous of the honour of his whiskers, which he was pleased to
christen "the emblems of his virility," that he resolutely made the
sun shine through every unhappy cat that ill-fate threw in his way.
He magnanimously professed that his spirit could not brook it,
that any cat in Christendom, noble or ignoble, should rival the
reputation of his upper lip. In every other respect our physician
was a well-bred person, and, which is as wonderful, understood
Latin. But we see the deepest learning is no charm against the
spleen.'</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Of Ghosts.</span></p>

<p>'All sorts of people, when they get together, will find something
to talk of. News, politics, and stocks comprise the conversation
of the busy and trading world. Rakes and men of
pleasure fight duels with men they never spoke to, and betray
women they never saw, and do twenty fine feats over their cups
which they never do anywhere else. And children, servants, and
old women, and others of the same size of understanding, please
and terrify themselves and one another with spirits and goblins.
In this case a ghost is no more than a help to discourse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>'A late very pious but very credulous bishop was relating a
strange story of a demon, that haunted a girl in Lothbury, to a
company of gentlemen in the City, when one of them told his
lordship the following adventure:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-328.jpg" width="256" height="139" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'"As I was one night reading in bed, as my custom is, and all
my family were at rest, I heard a foot deliberately ascending the
stairs, and as it came nearer I heard something breathe. While I
was musing what it should be, three hollow knocks at my door
made me ask who was there, and instantly the door blew open."
"Ah! sir, and pray what did you see?" "My lord, I'll tell you.
A tall thin figure stood before me, with withered hair, and an
earthly aspect; he was covered with a long sooty garment, that
descended to his ankles, and his waist was clasped close within a
broad leathern girdle. In one hand he held a black staff taller
than himself, and in the other a round body of pale light, which
shone feebly every way." "That's remarkable! pray, sir, go on."
"It beckoned to me, and I followed it down stairs, and there it
pointed to the door, and then left me, and made a hideous noise
in the street." "This is really odd and surprising; but, pray now,
did it give you no notice what it might particularly seek or aim
at?" "Yes, my lord, it was the watchman, who came to show
me that my servants had left all my doors open."'

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Of Keeping the Commandments.</span></p>

<p>'I have been humbly of opinion for many years that the keeping
of the Ten Commandments was a matter not altogether unworthy
of our consideration and practice; and though I am of the same
sentiments still, yet I dare hardly publish them, knowing that if I
am against the world, the world will be against me. I must not
affront modern politeness and the common mode.</p>

<p>'Who would have the boldness to mention the first commandment
to Matilda, when he has seen her curt'sying to herself in
the glass, and kissing her lap-dog, and worshipping these two
<i>divine creatures</i> from morning till night? Nor is Matilda without
other deities; she has several sets of china, a diamond necklace,
and a grey monkey; and, in spite of her parents and her reason,
she is guilty of will-worship to Dick Noodle. But this last is no
wonder at all, for Dick
wears fine brocade waistcoats
and the best Mechlin,
and no man of the age
picks his teeth with greater
elegance.</p>

'And would it not be
equally bold and barbarous
to enslave a beau or a bully
with the tyranny of the
third commandment? when
it's well known that these
worthy gentlemen and brothers
in understanding and
courage must either be dumb or damning themselves; and, therefore,
to stop their swearing would be to stop their breath, and gag
them to all eternity. Beau Wittol courts Arabella with great success,
and it is not doubted he will carry her, though he was never
heard to make any other speech or compliment to her than that
of "Demme, madam!" after which he squeezes her hand, takes
snuff, and grins in her face with wonderful wit and gaiety.
Arabella smiles, and owns with her eyes her admiration of these
<i>accomplishments of a fine gentleman</i>.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Of Flattery.</span></p>

<p>'Flattery <i>is the art of selling wind for a round sum of ready
money</i>. A sycophant blows up the mind of his unhappy patient
into a tympany, and then, like other physicians, receives a fee for
his poison. It is his business to instruct men to mistake themselves
at a great expense; to shut their eyes, and then pay for
being blind. Thus the end of excelling in any art or profession
is to have that excellence known and admired.</p>

<p>'Sing-song Nero, an ancestor of Mr. Tom d'Urfey, would, probably,
never have banished the sceptre and adopted the fiddle,
but that he found it much easier for his talents to scrape than to
govern. In this reign, he that had a musical ear, or could twist a
catgut, was made a man; and the fiddlers ruled the Roman
empire by the singular merit of condescending to be viler thrummers
than the emperor himself. He who at that time could but
<i>wonder greatly</i>, and <i>gape artfully</i> at his Majesty's <i>royal skill</i> in
crowding, might be governor of a province, or Lord High
Treasurer, or what else he pleased.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-330.jpg" width="239" height="129" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'This imperial piper used to go the circuit, and call the
provinces together, to be refreshed with a tune upon the fiddle,
and if they had the policy to smother a laugh, and raise an
outrageous clap, their taxes were paid, and they had whatever they
asked; and so miserably was this monarch and madman bewitched
by himself and his sycophants with the character of a victorious
fiddler, that when he was abandoned by God and man, and, as an
enemy to mankind, sentenced to be whipped to death, he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
grieve so much for the loss of his empire as the loss of his fiddle.
When he had no mortal left to flatter him, he flattered himself,
and his last words were, "<i>Qualis Artifex pereo!</i>&mdash;What a brave
scraper is lost in me!" And then he buried a knife in his inside,
and made his death the best action of his life!'</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Of Retirement.</span></p>

<p>'To be absolute master of one's own time and actions is an
instance of liberty which is not found but in solitude. A man that
lives in a crowd is a slave, even though all that are about him fawn
upon him and give him the upper-hand. They call him master, or
lord, and treat him as such; but as they hinder him from doing
what he otherwise would, the title and homage which they pay
him is flattery and contradiction.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-331.jpg" width="293" height="129" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'I ever loved retirement, and detested crowds; I would rather
pass an afternoon amongst a herd of deer, than half an hour at a
coronation; and sooner eat a piece of apple-pie in a cottage, than
dine with a judge on the circuit. To lodge a night by myself in a
cave would not grieve me so much as living half a day in a fair.
It will look a little odd when I own that I have missed many a
good sermon for no other reason but that many others were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
hear it as well as myself. I have neither disliked the man, nor
his principles, nor his congregation, singly; but altogether I could
not abide them.</p>

<p>'I am, therefore, exceedingly happy in the solitude which I
am now enjoying. I frequently stand under a tree, and with great
humanity pity one half of the world, and with equal contempt
laugh at the other half. I shun the company of men, and seek
that of oxen, and sheep, and deer, and bushes; and when I can
hide myself for the moiety of a day from the sight of every creature
but those that are dumb, I consider myself as monarch of all that
I see or tread upon, and fancy that Nature smiles and the sun
shines for my sake only.</p>

<p>'My eyes at those seasons are the seat of pleasure, and I do
not interrupt their ranging by the impertinence of memory, or
solicitude of any kind. I neither look a day forward nor a day
backward, but voluptuously enjoy the present moment. My mind
follows my senses, and refuses all images which these do not then
present.'</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Of Bubbles.</span></p>

<p>'The world has often been ruled by men who were themselves
ruled by the worst qualities and most sordid views. The <i>prince</i>,
says a great French politician, <i>governs the people, and interest
governs the prince</i>.</p>

<p>'Hence it comes to pass, that few men care how they rise in
the world, so they do but rise. They know that success expiates
all rogueries, and never misses reverence; and that he who was
called villain or murderer in the race, is often christened saint or
hero at the goal.</p>

<p>'The present possession of money or power is always a ready
patent for respect and submission. He that gets a hundred thousand
pounds by a bubble&mdash;that is, by selling a bag of wind to his
credulous countrymen&mdash;is a greater idol in every coffee-house in
town than he who is worth but ninety thousand, though acquired
by honest trading or ingenious arts, which profit mankind, and
bring credit to his country; and thus every South Sea cub shall,
by the sole merit of his million, vie for respect and followers with
any lord in the land, though it should strangely happen, as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
sometimes does, that his lordship's virtues and parts ennoble his
title and quality. It matters not whether your father was a tinker,
and you, his worthy son, a broker or a sharper, provided you be
but a South Sea man. If you are but that, the whole earth is your
humble servant.</p>

<p>'At present, nothing farther is necessary towards getting an
estate&mdash;that is, merit and respect&mdash;than a little money, much
roguery, and many lies. With what indignation have I beheld a
peer of the realm courting the good graces of a little haberdasher
with great cash, and begging a few shares in a bubble which the
honourable Goodman Bever had just then invented to cheat his
fellow-citizens!</p>

<p>'But exalted boobies being below satire, I shall here only consider
a little the mischiefs brought upon the public by the projects
which bring them their wealth. It is melancholy to consider that
power follows property, when we consider at the same time into
what vile hands the property is fallen, and by what vile means,
even by bubbles and direct cheating.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-333.jpg" width="222" height="113" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Of our second-hand bubbles, I blame not one more than
another; their name shows
their nature. The "Great
Bubble" of all set them
an example, and began
first. By it immense fortunes
have been got to
particular men, most of
them obscure and unheard
of; happy for
their own characters, and for the nation's trade, if they had still
remained so. I hope our all is not yet at the mercy of sharpers,
ignorant, mercenary sharpers; but I should be glad to see it
proved that it will not be so.'</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Of Travels.</span></p>

<p>'As every man is in his own opinion fit to come abroad in
print, so every occasion that can put him upon prating to mankind
is sufficient to put his pen running, provided he himself can hold
the principal character in his own book.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>

<p>'Of all the several classes of scribblers, there is none more
silly than your authors of Travels. There are several things
common to all these travellers, and yet peculiar to every particular
traveller. I have at this time in my hands a little manuscript,
entitled "Travels from <span class="smcap">Exeter to London</span>, with <i>proper observations</i>."
By the sagacity shown in the remarks, I take the author
to be some polite squire of Devon. In the following passages our
traveller records his observations in the great metropolis:&mdash;</p>

<p>'"In this great city people are quite another thing than what
they are out of it; insomuch, that he who will be very great with
you in the country, will scarce pull off his hat to you in London.
I once dined at Exeter with a couple of judges, and they talked to
me <i>there</i>, and drank my health, and we were very familiar
together. So when I saw them again passing through Westminster
Hall, I was glad of it with all my heart, and ran to them
with a broad smile, to ask them how they did, and to shake hands
with them; but they looked at me so coldly and so proudly as you
cannot imagine, and did not seem to know me, at which I was
confounded, angry, and mad; but I kept my mind to myself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-334.jpg" width="251" height="163" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'"At another time I was at the playhouse (which is a rare place
for mirth, music, and dancing), and, being in the pit, saw in one of
the boxes a member of Parliament of our county, with whom I
have been as great as hand and glove; so being overjoyed to see
him, I called to him aloud by his name, and asked him how he
did; but instead of saluting me again, or making any manner of
answer, he looked plaguy sour, and never opened his mouth,
though when he is in the country he is as merry a grig as any in
forty miles, and we have cracked many a bottle together."'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Of Education.</span></p>

<p>'People, put by their education into a narrow track of
thinking, are as much afraid of getting out of it as children of
quitting their leading-strings when first they learn to go. They
are taught a raging fondness for a parcel of names that are never
explained to them; and an implacable fierceness against another
set of names that are never explained to them; so they jog on in
the heavy steps of their forefathers, or in the wretched and narrow
paths of poor-spirited and ignorant pedagogues. They believe
they are certainly in the right, and therefore never take the pains
to find out that they are certainly in the wrong.</p>

<p>'From this cause it comes to pass that many English gentlemen
are as much afraid of reading some English books as were
the poor blind Papists of reading books prohibited by their
priests; which were, indeed, all books that had either religion or
sense in them.</p>

<p>'How nicely are those men taught who are taught prejudice!
A tincture of bigotry appears in all the actions of a bigot. He
will neither, with his good liking, eat or drink, or sleep or travel
with you, till he has received full conviction that you wash your
hands and pare your nails just as he does.</p>

<p>'Here is a squire come down from London who is very rich,
and has bought a world of land in our county of Wilts. The first
thing he did when he came among us was to declare that he would
have no dealings nor conversation with any Whig whatsoever; and,
to make his word good, having bespoke several beds and other
furniture to a considerable value of an upholsterer here, he returned
the whole upon the poor man's hands because his wife had
a brother who was a Presbyterian parson.</p>

<p>'But this worthy and ingenious squire was very well served by
an officer of the army at a horse race here. They were drinking,
among other company, the King's health, at the door of a public-house,
on horseback; the officer, when it came to his turn, drank
it to this Doughty Highflyer, who happened to be next to him,
upon which he made some difficulty at pledging it, suggesting that
public healths should not be proposed in mixed company. "You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
would say," says the officer, "if you durst, that a High Churchman
would not have his Majesty's health proposed to him at all."
Upon this he swore he was a High Churchman, and was not
ashamed of it. "So I guessed," said the officer, "by your disloyalty."
"But, Sir," says the officer, "even disloyalty to your prince
need not make you show your ill-breeding in company." The
squire chafed most violently at this, and urged, as a proof of his
good breeding, that he had been bred at Oxford.
"So I guessed," says the officer, "by your ignorance."
This nettled the squire to the height, and fired his
little soul at the expense of the outer case, for he
proceeded to give ill
words, and to call ill
names; but the officer
quickly taught him, by
the nose, to hold his
tongue, and ask pardon.
Thus it always fares with
the High Church in fighting as it does in disputing: she is constantly
beaten; and the courage and understanding of her passive
sons tally with each other.'</p>

<p>'Some of my fair correspondents have lately reproached me
with negligence and indifference to their sex; but if they could
know how vain I am of so obliging a reprimand, they would be
sensible, too, how little I deserved it. I am not so entirely a
statue as to be insensible of the power of beauty, nor so absolutely
a woman's creature as to be blind to their little weaknesses, their
pretty follies and impertinences.</p>

<p>'It will be necessary to inform my readers that my landlady is
an eminent milliner, and a considerable dealer in Flanders lace.
She is one of those whom we call notable women; she has run
through the rough and smooth of life, has a very good plain sense
of things, and knows the world, as far as she is concerned in it,
very well. I am very much entertained by her company; her
discourse is sure to be seasoned with scandal, ancient and modern,
which, though the morals and gravity of my character do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>

<p>'If I come in at a time when the shop, which is commodiously
situated above stairs, is full of company, I usually place myself in
an obscure corner of it, and observe
what passes with secret satisfaction. 'Tis
pleasant to hear my landlady, by the
mere incessancy of tittle-tattle, persuade
her pretty customers out of all the understanding
that they brought along with
them; and on the other side of the counter
to see the little bosoms pant with irresolution,
and swell at the view of trifles, which humour and custom
have taught them to call necessary and convenient. Hard by
perhaps stands a customer of inferior quality, a citizen's wife
suppose her, who is reduced to the hard necessity of regulating her
expenses by her husband's allowance, and is bursting with vexation
to know herself stinted to lace of but fifty shillings a yard; whereas
if she could rise to three pounds, she might be mistress of a very
pretty head, and what she really thinks she need not be ashamed
to be seen in. But for want of this all goes wrong; she hates her
superiors, despises her husband, neglects her children, and is
ashamed and weary of herself.</p>

<p>'This seems ridiculous to my men readers, and it certainly is
so; but are our follies and extravagances more reasonable?
Or, rather, are they not infinitely more
dangerous and destructive? What violences
do we not commit upon our consciences
for the mere gratification of our
avarice? How much of the real ease and
happiness of life do we daily sacrifice to
the vanity of ambition? Is it possible,
then, since even the greatest men are but a
bigger sort of children, to be seriously angry that women are no
more? If in my old age I am struck with the harmony of a
rattle, or long to get astride on a hobby-horse; if I love still to be
caressed and flattered, and am delighted with good words and
high titles, why should I be angry that my wife and daughters do
not play the philosopher, and have not more wit than myself?

<p>'I must desire my reader, as he values his repose, not to let
his thoughts run upon anything loose or frightful for two hours at
least before he goes to bed. <i>Titus Livius</i>, the Roman historian,
is my usual entertainment, when I don't find myself disposed for
closer application. Happening to come home sooner than ordinary
two nights ago, I took it up, and read the 8th and following
chapters of his 39th book, where he gives us a large account of
some nocturnal assemblies lately set up at Rome; I think he calls
them <i>Bacchanals</i>, and describes the ceremonies, rites of initiation,
and religious practices, together with their music, singing, shrieks,
and howlings. The men were dressed like satyrs, and raved like
persons distracted, with enthusiastic motions of the head and
violent distortions of the body. The ladies ran with their hair
about their ears and burning torches in their hands; some covered
with the skins of panthers, others with those of tigers, all attended
with drums and trumpets, while they themselves were the most
noisy. "To this diversion," says the historian, "were added the
pleasures of feasting and wine to draw the more in; and when
wine, the night, and a mixed company of men and women, jumbled
together, had extinguished all sense of shame, there were extravagances
of all sorts committed; each having that pleasure ready
prepared for him to which his nature was most inclined."</p>

I unluckily fell under myself. The very idea of it makes
me tremble still, when I think of those monstrous habits, fantastical
gestures, hideous faces, and confused noises I had in my
sleep. Join to these the many assignations made for the next
night, the signs given for the present execution of former agreements;
and the various plots and contrivances I overheard, for
parting man and wife, and ruining whole families at once. These
frightful appearances put me into such uncommon agitations of
body, and I looked so ghastly at my first waking, that a friend of
mine, who came early in the morning to make me a visit, was
struck with such a terror at the sight of me, that he made to the
street door as fast he could, where he had only time to bid one
of my servants run for a physician immediately, for he was sure I
was going mad.'</p>

<p>'The multitude of papers is a complaint so common in the
introduction of every new one, that it would be a shame to repeat
it; for my own part, I am so far
from repining at this evil, that I
sincerely wish there were ten times
the number. By this means one
may hope to see the appetite for
impertinence, defamation, and treason
(so prevalent in the generality
of readers) at last surfeit itself, and
my honoured brethren the modern
authors be obliged to employ themselves
in some more honest manufacture
than that of the <i>Belles Lettres</i>.</p>

<p>''Tis impossible for one who has
the least knowledge and regard for
his country's interest to look into a
coffee-house without the greatest
concern. Industry and application
are the true and genuine honour of
a trading city; where these are everywhere visible all is well.
Whenever I see a false thirst for knowledge in my own countrymen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
I am sorry they ever learnt to read. I would not be thought
an enemy to literature (being, indeed, a very learned person myself),
but when I observe a worthy trader, without any natural
malice of his own, sucking in the poison of popularity, and boiling
with indignation against an administration which the pamphleteer
informs him is very corrupt, I am grieved that ever <i>Machiavel</i>,
<i>Hobbes</i>, <i>Sidney</i>, <i>Filmer</i>, and the more illustrious moderns, including
myself, appeared in human nature.</p>

<p>'Idleness is the parent of innumerable vices, and detraction is
generally the first, though not immediately the most mischievous,
that is born of it. The mind of man is of such an ill make that it
relishes defamation much better than applause; so every writer
who makes his court to the multitude must sacrifice his superiors
to his patrons.</p>

<p>'That there is a very great and indefeasible authority in the
people, or Commons of Great Britain, everyone allows. Power is
ever naturally and rightfully founded in those who have anything
to risk; and this power delegated into the hands of Parliament, it
there becomes legally absolute, and the people are, by their very
constitution, obliged to a passive obedience.</p>

<p>'Nothing is better known than this, nothing on all sides more
generally allowed, and one would imagine nothing could sooner
silence the clamour of little statesmen and politicians; that jargon
of public-spiritedness, which wastes so much of the time of the busy
part of our countrymen. The misfortune is that though everyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
(who is not indeed crack-brained with the love of his country) will
own that the populace, by having delegated the right of inspecting
public affairs to others, have no authority to be troublesome about
it themselves, yet everyone excepts himself from the multitude,
and imagines that his own particular talent for public business
ought to exempt him from so severe a restraint. Hence arises the
great demand for newspapers and coffee. Happy is it for the
nation and for the Government that the distemper and the medicine
are found at the same place, and the blue-apron officer who
presents you with a newspaper, to heat the brain and disturb the
understanding, is ready the same moment to apply those composing
specificks, a dish and a pipe. Otherwise, what revolutions
and abdications might we not expect to see? I should not be
surprised to hear that a general officer in the trained-bands had
run stark staring mad out of a coffee-house at noon day, declared
for a Free Parliament, and proclaimed my Lord Mayor King of
England.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="s08">THACKERAY'S RESEARCHES AMONGST THE WRITINGS OF THE EARLY
ESSAYISTS&mdash;<i>Continued.</i></span></h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
Characteristic Passages from the Works of The 'Humourists,' from Thackeray's
Library, illustrated by the Author's hand, with Marginal Sketches
suggested by the Text&mdash;<span class="smcap">The 'World</span>,' 1753&mdash;Introduction&mdash;Its Difference
from the Earlier Essays&mdash;Distinguished Authors who contributed to the
'World'&mdash;Paragraphs and Pencillings.
</p>

<p>The 'World'&mdash;writes Dr. Chalmers, in his historical and biographical
preface to this series&mdash;differs from its predecessors in
the general plan, although the ultimate tendency is similar. We
have here no philosophy of morals, no indignant censure of the
grosser vices, no critical disquisitions, and, in general, scarcely
anything serious. Irony is the predominant feature. This caustic
species of wit is employed in the 'World' to execute purposes
which other methods had failed to accomplish.</p>

<p>The authors of these essays affected to consider the follies of
their day as beneath their notice, and therefore tried what good
might be done by turning them into ridicule, under the mask of
defence or apology, and thus ingeniously demonstrated that every
defence of what is in itself absurd and wrong, must either partake
of the ridiculous, or be intolerable and repugnant to common
sense and reason. With such intentions, notwithstanding their
apparent good humour, they may, perhaps, in the apprehension
of many readers, appear more severe censors of the foibles of the
age than any who have gone before them.</p>

<p>The design, as professed in the first paper, was to ridicule,
with novelty and good humour, the fashions, foibles, vices, and
absurdities of that part of the human species which calls itself
'The World;' and this the principal writers were enabled to
execute with facility, from the knowledge incidental to their rank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
in life, the elevated sphere in which they moved, their intercourse
with a part of society not easily accessible to authors in general,
and the good sense which prevented them from being blinded by
the glare or enslaved by the authority of fashion.</p>

<p>The 'World' was projected by Edward Moore<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
&mdash;in conjunction
with Robert Dodsley, the eminent publisher of Johnson's
'Dictionary'&mdash;who fixed upon the name; and by defraying the
expense, and rewarding Moore, became, and for many years
continued to be, the sole proprietor of the work.</p>

<p>Edward Moore's abilities, his modest demeanour, inoffensive
manners, and moral conduct, recommended him to the men of
genius and learning of the age, and procured him the patronage
of Lord Lyttleton, who engaged his friends to assist him in the
way which a man not wholly dependent would certainly prefer.
Dodsley, the publisher, stipulated to pay Moore three guineas for
every paper of the 'World' which he should write, or which might
be sent for publication and approved of. Lord Lyttleton, to
render this bargain effectual, and an easy source of emolument to
his <i>protégé</i>, solicited the assistance of such men as are not often
found willing to contribute the labours of the pen, men of high
rank in the state, and men of fame and fashion, who cheerfully
undertook to supply the paper, while Moore reaped the emolument,
and perhaps for a time enjoyed the reputation of the whole.
But when it became known, as the information soon circulated in
whispers, that such men as the Earls of Chesterfield, Bath, and
Cork&mdash;that Horace Walpole, Richard Owen Cambridge, and
Soame Jenyns&mdash;besides other persons of both distinction and
parts&mdash;were leagued in a scheme of authorship to amuse the town,
and that the 'World' was the bow of Ulysses, in which it was 'the
fashion for men of rank and genius to try their strength,' we may
easily suppose that it would excite the curiosity of the public in an
uncommon degree.</p>

<p>The first paper was published January 24, 1753; it was
consequently contemporary with the 'Adventurer,' which began
November 7, 1752; but as the 'World' was published only once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
a week, it outlived the 'Adventurer' nearly two years, during
which time it ran its course also with the 'Connoisseur.' It was
of the same size and type and at the same price with the 'Rambler'
and 'Adventurer,' but the sale in numbers was superior to either.
In No. 3, Lord Chesterfield states that the number sold weekly
was two thousand, which number, he adds, 'exceeds the largest
that was ever printed, even of the "Spectator."' In No. 49, he
hints that 'not above <i>three</i> thousand were sold.' The sale was
probably not regular, and would be greater on the days when
rumour announced his lordship as the writer. The usual number
printed was two thousand five hundred, as stated in a letter from
Moore to Dr. Warton. Notwithstanding the able assistance of his
right honourable friends, Moore wrote sixty-one of these papers,
and part of another. He excelled principally in assuming the
serious manner for the purposes of ridicule, or of raising idle
curiosity; his irony is admirably concealed. However trite his
subject, he enlivens it by original turns of thought.</p>

<p>In the last paper, the conclusion of the work is made to
depend on a fictitious accident which is supposed to have happened
to the author and occasioned his death. When the papers
were collected in volumes, Moore superintended the publication,
and actually died while this last paper was in the press: a circumstance
somewhat singular, when we look at the contents of it, and
which induces us to wish that death may be less frequently included
among the topics of wit.</p>

<p>It has been the general opinion, for the honour of rank, that
the papers written by men of that description in the 'World' are
superior to those of Moore, or of his assistants of 'low degree.'
It may be conceded that among the contributories the first place
is due, in point of genius, taste, and elegance, to the pen of
Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield's services to this paper were purely voluntary,
but a circumstance occurred to his first communication which had
nearly disinclined him to send a second. He sent his paper to the
publisher without any notice of its authorship; it underwent a
casual inspection, and, from its length, was at least delayed, if
not positively rejected. Fortunately Lord Lyttleton saw it at
Dodsley's, and knew the hand. Moore then hastened to publish
the paper (No. 18), and thought proper to introduce it with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
apology for the delay, and a neat compliment to the wit and good
sense of his correspondent.</p>

<p>Chesterfield continued his papers occasionally, and wrote in
all twenty-three numbers, certainly equal, if not superior, in brilliancy
of wit and novelty of thought, to the most popular productions
of this kind.</p>

<p>A certain interest surrounds most of the authors who assisted
in the 'World,' and many of the papers were written under circumstances
which increase the attraction of their contents. We
have not space to particularise special essays, or to enter upon the
biographical details which properly belong to our subject; we must
restrict further notice to a mere recapitulation of the contributors
and their pieces. Richard Owen Cambridge, the author of the
'Scribleriad,' wrote in all twenty-one papers. Horace Walpole
was the author of nine papers in the 'World,' all of which excel in
keen satire, shrewd remark, easy and scholarly diction, and knowledge
of mankind; indeed, for sprightly humour these papers
probably excel all his other writings, and most of those of his
contemporaries. For five papers we are indebted to Soame Jenyns,
who held the office and rank of one of the Lords Commissioners
of the Board of Trade and Plantations. James Tilson,
Consul at Cadiz, furnished five papers of considerable merit and
novelty. Five papers, chiefly of the more serious kind, were
contributed by Edward Loveybond; the 'Tears of Old May-Day,'
No. 82 of the 'World,' is esteemed one of his best poetic
compositions.</p>

<p>W. Whitehead, the Poet Laureate, wrote three papers, Nos. 12,
19, and 58. Nos. 79, 156, 202 were written by Richard Berenger,
Gentleman of the Horse to the King. Sir James Marriott, Judge
of the High Court of Admiralty, and Master of Trinity Hall,
Cambridge, wrote Nos. 117, 121, 199. The 'Adventures of the
Pumpkin Family,' zealous to defend their honour, given in
Nos. 47 and 63, were written by John, Earl of Cork and Orrery,
the amiable nobleman who, as Johnson whimsically declared, '<i>was
so generally civil, that nobody thanked him for it</i>.' The Earl of
Cork is also said to have contributed Nos. 161 and 185; he took
a more active part in the 'Connoisseur.'</p>

<p>To his son, Mr. Hamilton Boyle, who afterwards succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
to the earl's title, the 'World' was indebted for Nos. 60 and 170,
two papers drawn up with vivacity, humour, and elegance.</p>

<p>William Pulteney, Earl of Bath, to whom the second volume
of the 'Guardian' was dedicated, contributed to the 'World,' in
his seventy-first year, No. 7, a lively paper on horse-racing and the
manners of Newmarket.</p>

<p>Three papers, Nos. 140, 147, and 204, specimens of easy and
natural humour, came from the pen of Sir David Dalrymple, better
known as Lord Hailes, one of the senators of the College of
Justice in Scotland; in advanced life Lord Hailes contributed
several papers remarkable for vivacity and point to the 'Mirror.'
William Duncombe, a poetical and miscellaneous writer, was the
author of the allegory in No. 84; his son, the Rev. John Duncombe,
of Canterbury, was the author of No. 36. The latter
gentleman appears in connection with the 'Connoisseur.' Nos.
38 and 74 were written by Mr. Parratt, the author of some poems
in Dodsley's collection. Nos. 78 and 86 are from the pen of the
Rev. Thomas Cole.</p>

<p>The remaining writers in the 'World' were single-paper men,
but some of them of considerable distinction in other departments
of literary and of public life.</p>

<p>No. 15 was written by the Rev. Francis Coventrye. No. 26
was the production of Dr. Thomas Warton, who was then contributing
to the 'Adventurer.' In No. 32 criticism is treated with
considerable humour as a species of disease by the publisher,
Robert Dodsley, whose popularity extended to all ranks.</p>

<p>No. 37, like Lord Chesterfield's first contributions, was accorded
the honour of an extra half-sheet, rather than that the excellences
of the letter should be curtailed. It is not only the longest, but is
considered one of the best papers in the collection. It was
written by Sir Charles Hunbury Williams, for some time the English
Minister at the Courts of Berlin and St. Petersburgh. A
humorous letter on posts (No. 45) was from the pen of William
Hayward Roberts, afterwards Provost of Eton College, Chaplain
to the King, and Rector of Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire.
One of the best papers for delicate irony to be found in the entire
series of humorous essayists, No. 83, on the 'Manufactory of
Thunder and Lightning,' was written by Mr. William Whittaker, a
serjeant-at-law and a Welsh judge.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span></p>

<p>Nos. 110 and 159 are attributed to John Gilbert Cooper, author
of the 'Life of Socrates,' and 'Letters on Taste.' Thomas
Mulso, a brother of Mrs. Chapone, is set down as the writer of
No. 31. He published, in 1768, 'Calistus, or the Man of Fashion,'
and 'Sophronius, or the Country Gentleman in Dialogues.' James
Ridley, author of the 'Tales of the Genii' and of the 'Schemer,'
contributed No. 155. Mr. Gataker, a surgeon of eminence, was the
author of No. 184. Mr. Herring, rector of Great Mongeham, Kent,
wrote No. 122, on the 'Distresses of a Physician without Patronage.'
Mr. Moyle wrote No. 156, on 'False Honour,' and Mr. Burgess
No. 198, an excellent paper on the 'Difficulty of Getting Rid of
Oneself.' The 'Ode to Sculpture,' in No. 200, was written by
James Scott, D.D. Forty-one papers were written by persons
whose names were either unknown to the publisher, or who desired
to remain anonymous.</p>

<p>The 'World' has been frequently reprinted, and will probably
always remain a favourite, for its materials, although sustained by
the most whimsical raillery, are not of a perishable kind. The
manners of fashionable life are not so mutable in their principles as
is commonly supposed, and those who practise them may at least
boast that they have stronger stamina than to yield to the attacks
of wit or morals.</p>

<p>'Whoever is a frequenter of public assemblies, or joins in a
party of cards in private families, will give evidence to the truth of
this complaint.</p>

<p>'How common is it with some people, at the conclusion of
every unsuccessful hand of cards, to burst forth into sallies of
fretful complaints of their own amazing ill-fortune and the constant
and invariable success of their antagonists! They have such
excellent memories as to be able to recount every game they have
lost for six months successively, and yet are so extremely forgetful
at the same time as not to recollect a single game they have won.
Or if you put them in mind of any extraordinary success that you
have been witness to, they acknowledge it with reluctance, and
assure you, upon their honours, that in a whole twelvemonth's
play they never rose winners but that once.

<p>A worthy gentleman, who is suffering from the consequences
of treating his wife and daughter to a visit to Paris, is describing,
in a letter to Mr. FitzAdam, the follies into which the ladies of
his party were betrayed 'in order to fit themselves out to appear,
as the French say, <i>honnêtement</i>.'</p>

<p>'In about three days,' writes the victim of these vagaries of
fashion, 'the several mechanics, who were charged with the care
of disguising my wife and daughter, brought home their respective
parts of the transformation. More than the whole morning was
employed in this operation, for we did not sit down to dinner till
near five o'clock. When my wife and daughter came at last into
the eating-room, where I had waited for them at least two hours, I
was so struck with their transformation that I could neither conceal
nor express my astonishment. "Now, my dear," said my
wife, "we can appear a little like Christians." "And strollers
too," replied I; "for such have I seen at Southwark Fair. This
cannot surely be serious!" "Very serious, depend upon it, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
dear," said my wife; "and pray, by the way, what may there be
ridiculous in it?"</p>

<p>'Addressing myself to my wife and daughter, I told them I
perceived that there was a painter now in Paris who coloured
much higher than Rigault, though he did not paint near so like;
for that I could hardly have guessed them to be the pictures of
themselves. To this they both answered at once, that red was
not paint; that no colour in the world was <i>fard</i> but white, of
which they protested they had none.</p>

<p>'"But how do you like my <i>pompon</i>, papa?" continued my
daughter; "is it not a charming one? I think it is prettier than
mamma's." "It may be, child, for anything that
I know; because I do not know what part of all
this frippery thy <i>pompon</i> is." "It is this, papa,"
replied the girl, putting up her hand to her head,
and showing me in the middle of her hair a complication
of shreds and rags of velvets, feathers,
and ribands, stuck with false stones of a thousand
colours, and placed awry.</p>

<p>'"But what hast thou done to thy hair,
child, and why is it blue? Is that painted, too,
by the same eminent hand that coloured thy
cheeks?" "Indeed, papa," answered the girl,
"as I told you before, there is no painting in
the case; but what gives my hair that bluish
cast is the grey powder, which has always that
effect on dark-coloured hair, and sets off the complexion
wonderfully." "Grey powder, child!"
said I, with some surprise; "grey hairs I knew
were venerable; but till this moment I never
knew they were genteel." "Extremely so, with some complexions,"
said my wife; "but it does not suit with mine, and I
never use it." "You are much in the right, my dear," replied I,
"not to play with edge-tools. Leave it to the girl." This, which
perhaps was too hastily said, was not kindly taken; my wife was
silent all dinner-time, and I vainly hoped ashamed. My daughter,
intoxicated with her dress, kept up the conversation with herself, till
the long-wished-for moment of the opera came, which separated
us, and left me time to reflect upon the extravagances which I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
already seen, and upon the still greater which I had but too much
reason to dread.'</p>

<p>I am not so partial to the ladies, particularly the unmarried
ones, as to imagine them without fault; on the contrary, I am
going to accuse them of a very great one, which, if not put a stop
to before the warm weather comes in, no mortal can tell to what
lengths it may be carried. You have already hinted at this fault
in the sex, under the genteel appellation of moulting their dress.
If necks, shoulders, &amp;c., have begun to shed their covering in
winter, what a general display of nature are we to expect this summer,
when the excuse of heat may be alleged in favour of such a
display! I called some time ago upon a friend of mine near St.
James's, who, upon my asking where his sister was, told me, "At
her toilette, undressing for the ridetto." That the expression may
be intelligible to every one of your readers, I beg leave to inform
them that it is the fashion for a lady to undress herself to go abroad,
and to dress only when she stays at home and sees no company.</p>

<p>'It may be urged, perhaps, that the nakedness in fashion is
intended only to be emblematical of the innocence of the present
generation of young ladies; as we read of our first mother before
the fall, that <i>she was naked and not ashamed</i>; but I cannot help
thinking that her daughters of these times should convince us that
they are entirely free from original sin, or else be ashamed of their
nakedness.

<p>'I would ask any pretty miss about town, if she ever went a
second time to see the wax-work, or the lions, or even the dogs or
the monkeys, with the same delight as at first? Certain it is that
the finest show in the world excites but little curiosity in those
who have seen it before. "That was a very fine picture," says
my lord, "<i>but I had seen it before</i>." "'Twas a sweet song," says
my lady, "<i>but I had heard it before</i>." "A very fine poem," says
the critic, "<i>but I had read it before</i>." Let every lady, therefore,
take care, that while she is displaying in public a bosom whiter
than snow, the men do not look as if they were saying, "'Tis very
pretty, <i>but we have seen it before</i>."'</p>

<p>'A recent visit to Bedlam revived an opinion I have often
entertained, that the maddest people in the kingdom are not <i>in</i> but
<i>out</i> of Bedlam. I have frequently compared in my own mind the
actions of certain persons whom we daily meet with in the world
with those of Bedlam, who, properly speaking, may be said to be
out of it; and I know of no difference between them, than that
the former are mad with their reason about them, and the latter so
from the misfortune of having lost it. But what is extraordinary
in this age, when, to its honour be it spoken, charity is become
fashionable, these unhappy wretches are suffered to run loose
about the town, raising riots in public assemblies, beating constables,
breaking lamps, damning parsons, affronting modesty,
disturbing families, and destroying their own fortunes and constitutions;
and all this without any provision being made for them,
or the least attempt being made to cure them of this madness in
their blood.</p>

<p>'The miserable objects I am speaking of are divided into two
classes: the Men of Spirit about town, and the Bucks. The Men
of Spirit have some glimmerings of understanding, the Bucks
none; the former are demoniacs, or people possessed; the latter
are uniformly and incurably mad. For the reception and confinement
of both these classes, I would humbly propose that two very
spacious buildings should be erected, the one called the hospital
for the Men of Spirit or demoniacs, and the other the hospital for
the Bucks or incurables.

<p>'That after such hospitals are built, proper officers appointed,
and doctors, surgeons, apothecaries, and mad nurses provided, all
young noblemen and others within the bills of mortality having
common sense, who shall be found offending against the rules
of decency, shall immediately be conducted to the hospital for
demoniacs, there to be exorcised, physicked, and disciplined into a
proper use of their senses; and that full liberty be granted to all
persons whatsoever to visit, laugh at, and make
sport of these demoniacs, without let or molestation
from any of the keepers, according to the
present custom of Bedlam. To the Buck hospital
for incurables, I would have all such persons
conveyed that are mad through folly, ignorance,
or conceit; therefore to be shut up for life, not
only to be prevented from doing mischief, but
from exposing in their own persons the weaknesses
and miseries of mankind. The incurables
on no pretence whatsoever are to be visited or
ridiculed; as it would be altogether as inhuman
to insult the unhappy wretches who never were possessed of their
senses, as to make a jest of those who have unfortunately lost
them.'</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">On Toad-eating.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>'To Mr. FitzAdam.</i></p>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;I am the widow of a merchant with whom I lived
happily and in affluence for many years. We had no children,
and when he died he left me all he had; but his affairs were so
involved that the balance which I received, after having gone
through much expense and trouble, was no more than one thousand
pounds. This sum I placed in the hands of a friend of my
husband's, who was reckoned a good man in the City, and who
allowed me an interest of four per cent, for my capital; and with
this forty pounds a year I retired and boarded in a village about a
hundred miles from London.</p>

<p>'There was a lady, an old lady, of great fortune in that neighbourhood,
who visited often at the house where I lodged; she
pretended, after a short acquaintance, to take a great liking to me;
she professed friendship for me, and at length persuaded me to
come and live with her.</p>

<p>'One day, when her ladyship had treated me with uncommon
kindness for my having taken her part in a dispute with one of her
relations, I received a letter from London, to inform me that the
person in whose hands I had placed my fortune, and who till that
time had paid my interest money very exactly, was broke, and had
left the kingdom.</p>

<p>'I handed the letter to her ladyship, who immediately read it
over with more attention than emotion.</p>

<p>'Whenever Lady Mary spoke to me she had hitherto called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
me Mrs. Truman; but the very next morning at breakfast she left
out Mrs.; and upon no greater provocation than breaking a teacup,
she made me thoroughly sensible of her superiority and my
dependence. "Lord, Truman! you are so awkward; pray be
more careful for the future, or we shall not live long together. Do
you think I can afford to have my china broken at this rate, and
maintain you into the bargain?"</p>

<p>'From this moment I was obliged to drop the name and
character of friend, which I had hitherto maintained with a little
dignity, and to take up with that which
the French call <i>complaisante</i>, and the
English <i>humble companion</i>. But it did
not stop here; for in a week I was reduced
to be as miserable a toad-eater
as any in Great Britain, which in the
strictest sense of the word is a servant;
except that the toad-eater has the
honour of dining with my lady, and the misfortune of receiving

<p>'Sir,&mdash;Dim-sighted as I am, my spectacles have assisted me
sufficiently to read your papers. As a recompense for the pleasure
I have received from them, I send you a family anecdote, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
till now has never appeared in print. I am the grand-daughter of
Sir Josiah Pumpkin, of Pumpkin Hall, in South Wales. I was
educated at the hall-house of my own ancestors, under the care
and tuition of my honoured grandfather. It was the constant
custom of my grandfather, when he was tolerably free from the
gout, to summon his three grand-daughters to his bedside, and
amuse us with the most important transactions of his life. He
told us he hoped we would have children, to whom some of his
adventures might prove useful and instructive.</p>

<p>'Sir Josiah was scarce nineteen years old when he was introduced
at the Court of Charles the Second, by his uncle Sir Simon
Sparrowgrass, who was at that time Lancaster herald-at-arms, and
in great favour at Whitehall.</p>

<p>'As soon as he had kissed the King's hand, he was presented
to the Duke of York, and immediately afterwards to the ministers
and the mistresses. His fortune, which was considerable, and his
manners, which were elegant, made him so very acceptable in all
companies, that he had the honour to be plunged at once into
every polite party of wit, pleasure, and expense, that the courtiers
could possibly display. He danced with the ladies, he drank with
the gentlemen, he sang loyal catches, and broke bottles and
glasses in every tavern throughout London. But still he was by no
means a perfect fine gentleman. He had not fought a <span class="smcap">DUEL</span>. He
was so extremely unfortunate as never to have had even the happiness
of a <i>rencontre</i>. The want of opportunity, not of courage,
had occasioned this inglorious chasm in his character. He appeared,
not only to the whole court, but even in his own eye, an
unworthy and degenerate Pumpkin, till he had shown himself as
expert in opening a vein with a sword as any surgeon in England
could be with a lancet. Things remained in this unhappy situation
till he was near two-and-twenty years of age.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-356.jpg" width="257" height="103" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'At length his better stars prevailed, and he received a most
egregious affront from Mr. Cucumber, one of the gentlemen-ushers
of the privy-chamber. Cucumber, who was in waiting at court,
spit inadvertently into the chimney, and as he stood next to Sir
Josiah Pumpkin, part of the spittle rested upon Sir Josiah's shoe.
It was then that the true Pumpkin honour arose in blushes upon
his cheeks. He turned upon his heel, went home immediately,
and sent Mr. Cucumber a challenge. Captain Daisy, a friend to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
each party, not only carried the challenge, but adjusted preliminaries.
The heroes were to fight in Moorfields, and to bring
fifteen seconds on a side. Punctuality is a strong instance of
valour upon these occasions; the clock of St. Paul's struck seven
just when the combatants were marking out their ground, and
each of the two-and-thirty gentlemen was adjusting himself into
a posture of defence against his adversary. It happened to be the
hour for breakfast in the hospital of Bedlam. A small bell had
rung to summon the Bedlamites into the great gallery. The
keepers had already unlocked the cells, and were bringing forth
their mad folks, when the porter of Bedlam, Owen Macduffy,
standing at the iron gate, and beholding such a number of armed
men in the fields, immediately roared out, "Fire, murder, swords,
daggers, bloodshed!" Owen's voice was always remarkably loud,
but his fears had rendered it still louder and more tremendous.
His words struck a panic into the keepers; they lost all presence
of mind, they forgot their prisoners, and hastened most precipitately
down stairs to the scene of action. At the sight of the naked
swords their fears increased, and at once they stood open-mouthed
and motionless. Not so the lunatics; freedom to madmen and
light to the blind are equally rapturous. Ralph Rogers, the tinker,
began the alarm. His brains had been turned with joy at the
Restoration, and the poor wretch imagined that this glorious set
of combatants were Roundheads and Fanatics, and accordingly
he cried out, "Liberty and property, my boys! Down with the
Rump! Cromwell and Ireton are come from hell to destroy us.
Come, my Cavalier lads, follow me, and let us knock out their
brains." The Bedlamites immediately obeyed, and, with the tinker
at their head, leaped over the balusters of the staircase, and ran
wildly into the fields. In their way they picked up some staves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
and cudgels, which the porters and the keepers had inadvertently
left behind, and, rushing forward with amazing fury, they forced
themselves outrageously into the midst of the combatants, and
in one unlucky moment disturbed all the decency
and order with which this most illustrious
duel had begun.</p>

<p>'It seemed, according to my grandfather's
observation, a very untoward fate that two-and-thirty
gentlemen of courage, honour, fortune,
and quality should meet together in hopes of
killing each other with all that resolution and
politeness which belonged to their stations, and
should at once be routed, dispersed, and even
wounded by a set of madmen, without sword,
pistol, or any other more honourable weapon
than a cudgel.</p>

<p>'The madmen were not only superior in
strength, but numbers. Sir Josiah Pumpkin and
Mr. Cucumber stood their ground as long as
possible, and they both endeavoured to make
the lunatics the sole object of their mutual
revenge; but the two friends were soon overpowered,
and, no person daring to come to their
assistance, each of them made as proper a retreat
as the place and circumstances would
admit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-357.jpg" width="392" height="556" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Many other gentlemen were knocked down
and trampled under foot. Some of them, whom
my grandfather's generosity would never name,
betook themselves to flight in a most inglorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
manner. An earl's son was spied clinging submissively round the
feet of mad Pocklington, the tailor. A young baronet, although
naturally intrepid, was obliged to
conceal himself at the bottom of
Pippin Kate's apple-stall. A
Shropshire squire, of three thousand
pounds a year, was discovered,
chin deep and almost
stifled, in Fleet Ditch. Even
Captain Daisy himself was found
in a milk-cellar, with visible marks
of fear and consternation. Thus
ended this inauspicious day. But the madmen continued their
outrages many days after. It was near a week before they were
all retaken and chained to their cells, and during that interval of
liberty they committed many offensive pranks throughout the cities
of London and Westminster.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<p>'Such unforeseen disasters occasioned some prudent regulations
in the laws of honour. It was enacted from that time that
six combatants (three on a side) might be allowed and acknowledged
to contain such a quantity of blood in their veins as should
be sufficient to satisfy the highest affront that could be offered.'</p>

<p>One of Mr. FitzAdam's correspondents is describing a morning
he spent in the library of Lord Finican, with which nobleman
he was invited to breakfast:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I now fell to the books with a good appetite, intending to
make a full meal; and while I was chewing upon a piece of
Tully's philosophical writings, my lord came in upon me. His
looks discovered great uneasiness, which I attributed to the
effects of the last night's diversions; but good manners requiring
me to prefer his lordship's conversation to my own amusement,
I replaced his book, and by the sudden satisfaction in his countenance
perceived that the cause of his perturbation was my holding
open the book with a pinch of snuff in my fingers. He said
he was glad to see me, for he should not have known else what to
have done with himself. I returned the compliment by saying I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
thought he could not want entertainment amidst so choice a
collection of books. "Yes," replied he, "the collection is not
without elegance; but I read men only now, for I finished my
studies when I set out on my travels. You
are not the first who has admired my library;
and I am allowed to have as fine a taste in books
as any man in England."</p>

<p>'Hereupon he showed me a "Pastor Fido,"
bound in green and decorated with myrtle-leaves.
He then took down a volume of Tillotson,
in a black binding, with the leaves as white
as a law-book, and gilt on the back with little
mitres and crosiers; and lastly, Cæsar's "Commentaries,"
clothed in red and gold, in imitation of the military
uniform of English officers.'</p>

<p>The literary gentleman finally elicits that his lordship's books
are simply selected for fashion and show, and that they are never
read, Lord Finican having long given up the study of books, and
merely collecting a library to establish the excellence of his taste.</p>

<p>Mr. FitzAdam prints a letter received from a widow, describing
the real facts of the injuries by which her husband had lost his
life in a duel:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Mr. Muzzy was very fat and extremely lethargic, and so
stupidly heavy that he fell asleep even in musical assemblies, and
snored in the playhouse, as loud, poor man! as he used to snore
in bed. However, having received many taunts and reproaches,
he resolved to challenge his own cousin-german, Brigadier
Truncheon, of Soho Square. It seems the person challenged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
fixed upon the place and weapons. Truncheon, a deep-sighted
man, chose Primrose Hill for the field of battle, and swords for
the weapons of defence. To avoid suspicion and to prevent a
discovery, they were to walk together from Piccadilly, where we
then lived, to the summit of Primrose Hill. Truncheon's scheme
took effect. Mr. Muzzy was much fatigued and out of breath
with the walk. However, he drew his sword; and, as he assured
me himself, began to attack his cousin with valour. The brigadier
went back; Mr. Muzzy pursued; but not having his adversary's
alacrity, he stopped a little to take breath. He stopped, alas!
too long: his lethargy came on with more than usual violence; he
first dozed as he stood upon his legs, and then beginning to nod
forward, dropped by degrees upon his face in a most profound
sleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-360.jpg" width="389" height="105" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Truncheon, base man! took this opportunity to wound my
husband as he lay snoring on the ground; and he had the cunning
to direct his stab in such a manner as to make it supposed
that Mr. Muzzy had fled, and in his flight had received a wound
in the most ignominious part of his body. You will ask what
became of the seconds. They were both killed upon the spot;
but being only two servants, the one a butler and the other a
cook, they were buried the same night; and by the power of a
little money, properly applied, no further inquiry was made about
them.</p>

<p>'Mr. Muzzy, wounded as he was, might probably have slept
upon that spot for many hours, had he not been awakened by the
cruel bites of a mastiff. My poor husband was thoroughly
awakened by the new hurt he had received; and indeed it was
impossible to have slept while he was losing whole collops of the
fattest and most pulpy part of his flesh: so that he was brought
home to me much more wounded by the teeth of the mastiff than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
by the sword of his cousin Truncheon.' The wound eventually
mortified, Mr. Muzzy lost his life, and the writer became a
widow.</p>

<p>'I have hinted more than once that the present age (1754),
notwithstanding the vices and follies with which it abounds, has
the happiness of standing as high in my opinion as any age whatsoever.
But it has always been the fashion to believe that from
the beginning of the world to the present day men have been
increasing in wickedness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span></p>

<p>'I believe that all vices will be found to exist amongst us
much in the same degree as heretofore, forms only changing.</p>

<p>'Our grandfathers used to get drunk with strong beer and port;
we get drunk with claret and champagne. They would lie abominably
to conceal their peccadilloes;
we lie as abominably in
boasting of ours. They stole
slily in at the back-door of a
bagnio; we march in boldly at
the front-door, and immediately
steal out slily at the back-door.
Our mothers were prudes; their
daughters coquettes. The first
dressed like modest women, and perhaps were wantons; the last
dress like women of pleasure, and perhaps are virtuous. Those
treated without hanging out a sign; these hang out a sign without
intending to treat. To be still more particular: the abuse of
power, the views of patriots, the flattery of dependents, and the
promises of great men are, I believe, pretty much the same now
as in former ages. Vices that we have no relish for, we part with
for those we like; giving up avarice for prodigality, hypocrisy
for profligacy, and looseness for play.'</p>

<p>A correspondent, after summing up the lessons he daily extracts
from trees, flowers, insects, and the inmates of his garden,
continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>'In short, there is such a close affinity
between a proper cultivation of a flower-garden
and a right discipline of the mind
that it is almost impossible for any thoughtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
person, that has made any proficiency in the one, to avoid paying
a due attention to the other. That industry and care which are
so requisite to cleanse a garden from all sorts of weeds will naturally
suggest to him how much more expedient it would be to
exert the same diligence in eradicating all sorts of prejudices,
follies, and vices from the mind, where they will be sure to prevail,
without a great deal of care and correction, as common weeds
in a neglected piece of ground.</p>

<p>'And as it requires more pains to extirpate some weeds than
others, according as they are more firmly fixed, more numerous, or
more naturalised to the soil; so those faults will be found to be
most difficult to be suppressed which have been of the largest
growth and taken the deepest root, which are more predominant
in number and most congenial to the constitution.'</p>

<p>Mr. FitzAdam, defining the characters of <i>Siphons</i> and <i>Soakers</i>,
points to a theory that dropsy, of which so many of their order
perish, is a manifest judgment upon them, the wine they so much
loved being turned into water, and themselves drowned at last in
the element they so much abhorred.</p>

<p>'A rational and sober man, invited by the wit and gaiety of
good company, and hurried away by an uncommon flow of spirits,
may happen to drink
too much, and perhaps
accidentally to get drunk;
but then these sallies will
be short and not frequent.
Whereas the
soaker is an utter stranger to wit and mirth, and no friend to
either. His business is serious, and he applies himself seriously
to it; he steadily pursues the numbing, stupefying, and petrifying,
not the animating and exhilarating qualities of the wine. The
more he drinks, the duller he grows; his politics become more
obscure, and his narratives more tedious and less intelligible; till,
at last <i>maudlin</i>, he employs what little articulation he has left in
relating his doleful state to an insensible audience.</p>

<p>'I am well aware that the numerous society of <i>siphons</i> (as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
shall for the future typify the soakers, suction being equally the
only business of both) will say, like Sir Tunbelly, "What would
this fellow have us do?" To which I am at no loss for an
answer: "Do anything else."'</p>

<p>'I heard the other day with great pleasure from my friend,
Mr. Dodsley, that Mr. Johnson's "English Dictionary," with a
grammar and history of our language, will be published this winter,
in two large volumes in folio.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-364.jpg" width="105" height="198" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Many people have imagined that so extensive a work would
have been best performed by a number of persons, who should
have taken their several departments of examining,
fitting, winnowing, purifying, and
finally fixing our language by incorporating
their respective funds into one joint stock.</p>

<p>'But, whether this opinion be true or false,
I think the public in general, and the republic
of letters in particular, are greatly obliged
to Mr. Johnson for having undertaken and
executed so great and desirable a work. Perfection
is not to be expected from man; but
if we are to judge by the various works of
Mr. Johnson already published, we have good
reason to believe that he will bring this as
near to perfection as any one man could do.
The plan of it, which we published some years ago, seems to
me to be a proof of it. Nothing can be more rationally imagined
or more accurately and elegantly expressed. I therefore recommend
the previous perusal of it to all those who intend to buy the
dictionary, and who, I suppose, are all those who can afford it.'</p>

<p>'An acquaintance of mine was robbed a few years ago, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
very near shot through the head by the going off of a pistol of the
accomplished Mr. M'Lean, yet the whole affair was conducted
with the greatest good breeding on both
sides. The robber, who had only taken
a purse <i>this way</i> because he had that
morning been disappointed of marrying
a great fortune, no sooner returned to
his lodgings than he sent the gentleman
two letters of excuses, which, with
less wit than the epistles of Voltaire,
had infinitely more natural and easy politeness in the turn of their
expressions. In the postscript he appointed a meeting at Tyburn,
at twelve at night, where the gentleman might <i>purchase again</i> any
trifles he had lost; and my friend has been blamed for not accepting
the rendezvous, as it seemed liable to be construed by ill-natured
people into a doubt of the <i>honour</i> of a man who had given
him all the satisfaction in his power for having unluckily been near
shooting him through the head.'</p>

<p>'My cobbler is also a politician. He reads the first newspapers
he can get, desirous to be informed of the state of affairs in
Europe, and of the street
robberies of London. He
has not, I presume, analysed
the interests of the respective
countries of Europe, nor
deeply considered those of
his own; still less is he systematically informed of the political
duties of a citizen and subject. But his heart and his habits
supply these defects. He glows with zeal for the honour and
prosperity of old England; he will fight for it if there be an occasion,
and drink to it perhaps a little too often and too much.
However, is it not to be wished that there were in this country six
millions of such honest and zealous, though uninformed, citizens?</p>

<p>'Our honest cobbler is thoroughly convinced, as his forefathers
were for many centuries, that one Englishman can beat three
Frenchmen; and in that persuasion he would by no means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
decline the trial. Now, though in my own private opinion,
deduced from physical principles, I am apt to believe that one
Englishman could beat no more than two Frenchmen of equal
size with himself, I should, however, be unwilling to undeceive
him of that useful and sanguine error, which certainly made his
countrymen triumph in the fields of Poictiers and Crecy.'</p>

<p>'As I was musing one morning, in a most disconsolate mood,
with my leg in my landlady's lap, while she darned one of my
stockings, it came into my head to collect from various books,
together with my own experience and observations, plain and
wholesome rules on the subject of <i>diet</i>, and then publish them in
a neat pocket volume; for I was always well inclined to do good
to the world, however ungratefully it used me. I doubt, Mr.
FitzAdam, you will hardly forbear smiling to hear a man who was
almost starved talk gravely of compiling observations on diet.
The moment I finished my volume I ran to an eminent bookseller
near the Mansion House; he was just set down to dinner....
As soon as the cloth was taken away I produced my manuscript,
and the bookseller put on his spectacles; but to my no small
mortification, after glancing an eye over the title-page, he looked
steadfastly upon me for near a minute in a kind of amazement I
could not account for, and then broke out in the following manner:&mdash;"My
dear sir, you are come to the very worst place in the world
for the sale of such a <i>performance</i> as this&mdash;to think of expecting
the Court of Aldermen's permission to preach upon the subject of
<i>lean and fallow abstinence</i> between the Royal Exchange and

for clothes; and, to <i>say the truth</i>, till within the last week he has
dressed with great propriety and decency, when all at once, to our
great confusion and distress, he has the assurance to appear at
the sideboard in a pair of filthy nankin breeches, and those made
to fit so extremely tight, that a less curious observer might have
mistaken them for no breeches at all. The shame and confusion
so visible in all our faces one would think would suggest to him
the odiousness of his dress; but the fellow appears to have thrown
off every appearance of decency, for at tea-table before company,
as well as at meals, we are forced to endure him in this abominable
nankin, our modesty conflicting with nature, to efface the idea it
conveys.'</p>

of Priscilla's letter, with a warning to Patrick, and a general
decree against suggestive drapery, declaring it a capital offence, is

<p>'Hilarius is a downright country gentleman; a <i>bon vivant</i>; an
indefatigable sportsman. He can drink his gallon at a sitting, and
will tell you he was neither sick nor sorry in his life. Having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
an estate of above five thousand a year, his strong beer, ale, and
wine cellar are always well stored; to either of which, as also to
his table, abounding in plenty of good victuals, ill-sorted and ill-dressed,
every voter and fox-hunter claims a kind of right. He
roars for the Church, which he never visits, and is eternally cracking
his coarse jests and talking obscenity to the parsons, whom if
he can make fuddled, and expose to contempt, it is the highest
pleasure he can enjoy. As for his lay friends, nothing is more
common with him than to set them and their servants dead drunk
on their horses; and should any of them be found half smothered
in a ditch the next morning, it affords him excellent diversion for
a twelvemonth after. No one is readier to club a laugh with you,
but he has no ear to the voice of distress or complaint. Thus
Hilarius, on the false credit of generosity and good humour, swims
triumphantly with the stream of applause without one single virtue
in his composition.'</p>

<p>'At last I was sent to board with a distant relation, who had
been captain of a man-of-war, who had given up his commission
and retired into the country. Unfortunately for poor me, the
captain still retained a passion for firing a great gun, and had
mounted, on a little fortification that was thrown up against the
front of his house, eleven nine-pounders, which were constantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
discharged ten or a dozen times over on the arrival of visitors, and
on all holidays and rejoicings. The noise of these cannon was
more terrible to me than all the rest, and would have rendered my
continuance there intolerable, if a young gentleman, a relation of
the captain's, had not held me by the heart-strings, and softened
by the most tender courtship in the world the horrors of these
firings.'</p>

<p>'Among the ancient Romans the great offices of state were all
elective, which obliged them to be very observant of the shape of
the noses of those persons to whom they were to apply for votes.
Horace tells us that a sharp nose was an indication of satirical wit
and humour; for when speaking of his friend Virgil, though he
says, "At est bonus, ut melior non alius quisquam," yet he allows
he was no joker, and not a fit match
at the sneer for those of his companions
who had sharper noses than
his own. They also looked upon
the short noses, with a little inflection
at the end tending upwards, as
a mark of the owner's being addicted
to jibing; for the same author, talking of Mæcenas, says that
though he was born of an ancient family, yet was he not apt to
turn persons of low birth into ridicule, which he expresses by saying
that "he had not a turn-up nose." Martial, in one of his
epigrams, calls this kind of nose the rhinocerotic nose, and says
that everyone in his time affected this kind of snout, as an indication
of his being <i>master of the talent of humour</i>.'</p>

<p>'You may have frequently observed upon the face of that useful
piece of machinery, a clock, the minute and hour hands, in their
revolution through the twelve
divisions of the day, to be not
only shifting continually from
one figure to another, but to
stand at times in a quite opposite
direction to their former
bearings, and to each other.
Now I conceive this to be
pretty much the case with that
complicated piece of mechanism, a modern female, or young woman
of fashion: for as such I was accustomed to consider that part of
the species as having no power to determine their own motions
and appearances, but acted upon by the mode, and set to any
point which the party who took the lead, or (to speak more properly)
its regulator, pleased. But it has so happened in the circumrotation
of modes and fashions, that the present set are not
only moving on continually from one pretty fancy
and conceit to another, but have departed quite
aside from their former principles, dividing from each
other in a circumstance wherein they were always
accustomed to unite, and uniting where there was
ever wont to be a distinction or difference....
The pride now is to get as far away as possible, not only from the
vulgar, but from one another, and that, too, as well in the first
principles of dress as in its subordinate decorations; so that its
fluctuating humour is perpetually showing itself in some new and
particular sort of cap, flounce, knot, or tippet; and every woman
that you meet affects independency and to set up for herself.'</p>

<p>The writer describes a country assembly, highly perfumed with
'the smell of the stable over which it was built, the savour of the
neighbouring kitchen, the fumes of tallow candles, rum punch, and
tobacco dispersed over the house, and the balsamic effluvia from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
many sweet creatures who were dancing.' Everyone 'is pleased
and desirous of pleasing,' with the exception of some fashionable
young men blocking up the door&mdash;'whose faces I remember to
have seen about town, who would neither dance, drink tea, play
at cards, nor speak to anyone, except now and then in whispers
to a young lady, who sat in silence at the upper end of the room,
in a hat and négligée, with her back against the wall, her arms
akimbo, her legs thrust out, a sneer on her lips, a scowl on her
forehead, and an invincible assurance in her eyes. Their behaviour
affronted most of the company, yet obtained the desired effect:
for I overheard several of the country ladies say, "It was a pity
they were so proud; for to be sure they were prodigious well-bred
people, and had an immense deal of wit;" a mistake they could
never have fallen into had these patterns of politeness condescended
to have entered into any conversation.'</p>

<p>'There was an ancient sect of philosophers, the disciples of
Pythagoras, who held that the souls of men and all other animals
existed in a state of perpetual transmigration, and that when by
death they were dislodged from one corporeal habitation, they
were immediately reinstated in another, happier or more miserable
according to their behaviour in the former. This doctrine has
always appeared to me to present a theory of retributory compensation
which is very acceptable.</p>

<p>'Thus the tyrant, who by his power has oppressed his country
in the situation of a prince, in that of a slave may be compelled to
do it some service by his labour. The highwayman, who has stopped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
and plundered travellers, may expiate and assist them in the shape
of a post-horse; and mighty conquerors, who have laid waste the
world by their swords, may be obliged, by a small alteration in
sex and situation, to contribute to its re-peopling.</p>

<p>'For my own part, I verily believe this to be the case. I
make no doubt but Louis XIV. is now chained to an oar in the
galleys of France, and that Hernando Cortez is digging gold in the
mines of Peru or Mexico; that Dick Turpin, the highwayman, is
several times a day spurred backwards and forwards between
London and Epping, and that Lord * * * * and Sir Harry * * * *
are now roasting for a city feast. I
question not but that Alexander the
Great and Julius Cæsar have died
many times in child-bed since their
appearance in those illustrious and
depopulating characters; that Charles
XII. is at this instant a curate's wife
in some remote village with a numerous
and increasing family; and that Kouli-Khan is now
whipped from parish to parish in the person of a big-bellied
beggar-woman, with two children in her arms and three at her
back.'</p>

gallant them to the play, where, having seated the mother with
much ado, I offered my hand to the eldest of my five young

hoop with one hand only, she refused my offer, and at the first
step fell along. It was with great difficulty I got her up again;

the relief of all those whose country cousins, like mine, expect they
should introduce them into the world; by which means we shall
avoid appearing in a very ridiculous light. I would therefore set
up a person who should be known by the name of Town Usher.
His business should be to attend closely all young ladies who were
never in town before, to teach them to walk into playhouses without
falling over the benches, to show them the tombs and the
lions, and the wax-work and the giant, and instruct them how to
wonder and shut their mouths at the same time, for I really meet

the propriety of referring us to a person who traffics constantly to
that great mart of young divines, Cambridge, where the advertiser
might expect numbers to flock to the person he employed. It is
pleasant, too, to observe the "N.B." at the end of the advertisement;
it carries with it an air of significance enough to intimidate

<p>'Going to visit an old friend at his country seat last week, I
found him at backgammon with the vicar of the parish. My
friend received me with the heartiest welcome, and introduced the
doctor to my acquaintance. This gentleman, who seemed to be
about fifty, and of a florid and healthy constitution, surveyed me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
all over with great attention, and, after a slight nod of the head,
sat himself down without opening his mouth. I was a little hurt
at the supercilious behaviour of this divine, which my friend
observing, told me very pleasantly that I was rather too old to be
entitled to the doctor's complaisance, for he seldom bestowed it
but upon the young and vigorous; "but," says he, "you will know
him better soon, and may probably think it worth your while to
<i>book</i> him in the 'World,' for you will find him altogether as odd a
character as he is a worthy one." The doctor made no reply to
this raillery, but continued some time with his eye fixed upon me,
and at last shaking his head, and turning to my friend, asked if he
would play out the other hit. My friend excused himself from
engaging any more that evening, and ordered a bottle of wine,
with pipes and tobacco, to be set on the table. The vicar filled
his pipe, and drank very cordially to my friend, still eyeing me
with a seeming dislike, and neither drinking my health nor speaking
a single word to me. As I had long accustomed myself to
drink nothing but water, I called for a bottle of it, and drank glass
for glass with him; which upon the doctor's observing, he shook
his head at my friend, and in a whisper, loud enough for me to
hear, said, "Poor man! it is all over with him, I see." My friend
smiled, and answered, in the same audible whisper, "No, no,
doctor, Mr. FitzAdam intends to live as long as either of us." He
then addressed himself to me on the occurrences of the town, and
drew me into a very cheerful conversation, which lasted till I withdrew
to rest; at which time the doctor rose from his chair, drank
a bumper to my health, and, giving me a hearty shake by the
hand, told me I was a very jolly old gentleman, and that he
wished to be better acquainted with me during my stay in the
country.'</p>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;My case is a little singular, and therefore I hope you

the works of your predecessors, the "Tatlers," "Spectators," and

Freeman, with her Italian airs; but I have a wife more troublesome
than all three by a certain ridiculous and
unnecessary devotion that she pays to her father,
amounting almost to idolatry. When I first
married her, from that specious kind of weakness
which meets with encouragement and applause
only because it is called good-nature, I
permitted her to do whatever she pleased; but
when I thought it requisite to pull in the rein,
I found that her having the bit in her teeth
rendered the strength of my curb of no manner of use to me.
Whenever I attempted to draw her in a little, she tossed up her
head, snorted, pranced, and gave herself such airs, that unless I
let her carry me where she pleased, my limbs if not my life were

for having one creature in his house in which he might confide;
but when I heard that officers were to be appointed to knock out
the brains of all these honest domestics who should presume to
make their appearance in the streets without the passport of their
master's name about their necks, I became seriously concerned
for them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span></p>

<p>'This enmity against dogs is pretended upon the apprehension
of their going mad; but an easier remedy might be applied, by
abolishing the custom (with many others equally ingenious) of
stringing bottles and stones to their tails, by which means (and
in this one particular I must give up my clients) the unfortunate
sufferer becomes subject to the persecutions of his own species,
too apt to join the run against a brother in distress.</p>

<p>'Mr. FitzAdam,&mdash;Walking up St. James's Street the other
day, I was stopt by a very smart young female, who begged my
pardon for her boldness, and, looking very innocently in my face,
asked me if I did not know her. The manner of her accosting
me and the extreme prettiness of her figure made me look at her
with attention; and I soon recollected that she had been a
servant-girl of my wife's, who had taken her from the country, and,
after keeping her three years in her service, had dismissed her
about two months ago. "What, Nanny," said I, "is it you? I
never saw anybody so fine in all my life!" "Oh, sir!" says she,
with the most innocent smile imaginable, bridling her head and
curtsying down to the ground, "I have been led astray since I
lived with my mistress." "Have you so, Mrs. Nanny?" said I;
"and pray, child, who is it that has led you astray?" "Oh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
sir!" says she, "one of the worthiest gentlemen in the world;
and he has bought me a new négligée for every day in the week."</p>

<p>'The girl pressed me to go and look at her lodgings, which
she assured me were hard by in Bury Street, and as fine as a
duchess's; but I declined her offer, knowing that any arguments
of mine in favour of virtue and stuff gowns would avail but little
against pleasure and silk négligées. I therefore contented myself
with expressing my concern for the way of life she had entered
into, and bade her farewell.</p>

<p>'Being a man inclined to speculate a little, as often as I think
of the finery of this girl, and the reason alleged for it, I cannot
help fancying, whenever I fall in company with a pretty woman,
dressed out beyond her visible circumstances, patched, painted,
and ornamented to the extent of the mode, that she is going to
make me her best curtsy, and to tell me, "Oh, sir! I have been
led astray since I kept good company."'</p>

<p class="center">'<i>The Last of Mr. FitzAdam.</i></p>

<p>'Before these lines can reach the press, that truly great and
amiable gentleman, Mr. FitzAdam, will, in all probability, be no
more. An event so sudden and unexpected, and in which the
public are so deeply interested, cannot fail to excite the curiosity
of every reader. I shall, therefore, relate it in the most concise
manner I am able.</p>

<p>'The reader may remember that in the first number of the
"World," and in several succeeding papers, the good old gentleman
flattered himself that the profits of his labours would some
time or other enable him to make a genteel figure in the world,
and seat himself at last in his <i>one-horse chair</i>. The death of Mrs.
FitzAdam, which happened a few months since, as it relieved him
from the great expense of housekeeping, made him in a hurry to
set up his equipage; and as the sale of his paper was even beyond
his expectations, I was one of the first of his friends that advised
him to purchase it. The equipage was accordingly bespoke and
sent home; and as he had all along promised that his first visit in
it should be to me, I expected him last Tuesday at my country-house
at Hoxton. The poor gentleman was punctual to his
appointment; and it was with great delight that I saw him from
my window driving up the road that leads to my house. Unfortunately
for him, his eye caught mine; and hoping (as I suppose)
to captivate me by his great skill in driving, he made two or
three flourishes with his whip, which so frightened the horse that
he ran furiously away with the carriage, dashed it against a post,
and threw the driver from his seat with a violence hardly to be
conceived. I screamed out to my maid, "Lord bless me!" says
I, "Mr. FitzAdam is killed!" and away we ran to the spot where
he lay. At first I imagined that his head was off, but upon drawing
nearer I found it was his hat! He breathed, indeed, which
gave me hopes that he was not quite dead; but for signs of life, he
had positively none.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-380.jpg" width="294" height="201" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'In this condition, with the help of some neighbours, we
brought him into the house, where a warm bed was quickly got
ready for him; which, together with bleeding and other helps,
brought him by degrees to life and reason. He looked round
about him for some time, and at last, seeing and knowing me,
inquired after his chaise. I told him it was safe, though a good
deal damaged. "No matter, madam," he replied; "it has done
my business; it has carried me a journey from this world to the
next. I shall have no use for it again. The 'World' is now at
an end! I thought it destined to last a longer period; but the
decrees of fate are not to be resisted. It would have pleased me
to have written the last paper myself, but that task, madam, must
be yours; and, however painful it may be to your modesty, I conjure
you to undertake it.... My epitaph, if the public might be
so satisfied, I would have decent and concise. It would offend

</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Preface to the 'Connoisseur.'</span></p>

<p>The '<span class="smcap">Connoisseur</span>' was undertaken by a brace of congenial
wits, George Colman the elder, well known as a humourist and
dramatic writer, and Bonnel Thornton, both of whom at the time
they obliged the public with this publication were very young men,
still pursuing their studies at Oxford University. They appear to
have entered into a partnership, of which the following account is
given in their last paper:&mdash;'We have not only joined in the work
taken altogether,' says the writer of No. 140, 'but almost every
single paper is the product of both; and, as we have laboured
equally in erecting the fabric, we cannot pretend that any one
particular part is the sole workmanship of either. A hint has
perhaps been started by one of us, improved by the other, and still
further heightened by a happy coalition of sentiment in both, as
fire is struck out by a mutual collision of flint and steel. Sometimes,
like Strada's lovers conversing with the sympathetic needles,
we have written papers together at fifty miles' distance from
each other. The first rough draft or loose minutes of an essay
have often travelled in the stage-coach from town to country and
from country to town; and we have frequently waited for the
postman (whom we expected to bring us the precious remainder of
a "Connoisseur") with the same anxiety we should wait for the half
of a bank note, without which the other half would be of no value.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span></p>

<p>Such, indeed, was the similarity of manner, that, after some
years, the survivor, George Colman, was unable to distinguish his
share from that of his colleague in the case of those papers which
were written conjointly. Neither had an individuality of style by
which conjecture might be assisted. The prose compositions of
both were of the light and easy kind, sometimes with a dramatic
turn, and sometimes with an air of parody or imitation; and their
objects were generally the same, the existing follies and absurdities
of the day, which they chastised with ironical severity.</p>

<p>George Colman, by whom it is probable the 'Connoisseur'
was projected, was the son of Thomas Colman, British Resident
at the Court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany at Pisa, by a sister of
the Countess of Bath. He was born at Florence about the year
1733, and placed at a very early age at Westminster School, where
his talents soon became conspicuous, and where he contracted an
acquaintance with Lloyd, Churchill, Thornton, and others, who
were afterwards the reigning wits of the day, but unfortunately
only employed their genius on the perishable beings and events of
the passing hour. Colman was elected to Christ's Church in 1751,
and received the degree of M.A. in the month of March, 1758.</p>

<p>It was at that college he projected the 'Connoisseur,' which
was printed at Oxford by Jackson, and sent to London for publication;
it afforded the coadjutors a very desirable relaxation from
their classical studies, to which, however, Colman was particularly
attached, and which he continued to cultivate at a more advanced
period of life, his last publication being a translation of Horace's
'Art of Poetry.'</p>

<p>Bonnel Thornton, the colleague of George Colman in many
of his literary labours, was the son of an apothecary, and born in
Maiden Lane, London, in the year 1724. After the usual course
of education at Westminster School, he was elected to Christ's
Church, Oxford, in 1743. The first publication in which he was
concerned was the 'Student, or the Oxford Monthly Miscellany,'
afterwards altered to the 'Student, or Oxford and Cambridge
Monthly Miscellany.' This entertaining medley appeared in
monthly numbers, printed at Oxford, for Newbery, in St. Paul's
Churchyard. Smart was the principal conductor, but Thornton
and other writers of both Universities occasionally assisted.</p>

<p>Our author, in 1752, began a periodical work, entitled 'Have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
at ye All, or the Drury Lane Journal,' in opposition to Fielding's
'Covent Garden Journal.' It contains humorous remarks on
reigning follies, but indulges somewhat too freely in personal
ridicule.</p>

<p>Thornton took his degree of M.A. in April, 1750, and, as his
father wished him to make physic his profession, he took the
degree of Bachelor of that faculty, May 18, 1754; but his bent, like
that of Colman, was not to the severer studies, and they about this
time 'clubbed their wits' in the 'Connoisseur.'</p>

<p>According to their concluding motto:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Sure in the self-same mould their minds were cast,</p>
<p>Twins in affection, judgment, humour, taste.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The last number facetiously alludes to the persons and pursuits
of the joint projectors, by a sort of epigrammatic description of
Mr. Town. 'It has often been remarked that the reader is very
desirous of picking up some little particulars concerning the author
of the book he is perusing. To gratify this passion, many literary
anecdotes have been published, and an account of their life,
character, and behaviour has been prefixed to the works of our
most celebrated writers. Essayists are commonly expected to be
their own biographers; and perhaps our readers may require some
further intelligence concerning the authors of the "Connoisseur."
But, as they have all along appeared as a sort of <i>Sosias</i> in literature,
they cannot now describe themselves any otherwise than as
one and the same person; and can only satisfy the curiosity of the
public, by giving a short account of that respectable personage
Mr. Town, considering him as of the plural, or rather, according to
the Grecians, of the dual number.</p>

<p>'Mr. Town is a <i>fair</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
 black, middle-sized, <i>very short man</i>. He
<i>wears his own hair</i>, and a periwig. He is about thirty years of
age, and <i>not more than four-and-twenty</i>. He is <i>a student of the
law</i>, and a Bachelor of Physic. He was bred at the University of
Oxford, where, having taken no less than three degrees, he looks
down upon many learned professors as his inferiors; <i>yet, having
been there but little longer than to take the first degree of Bachelor
of Arts</i>, it has more than once happened that the Censor General
of all England has been reprimanded by the Censor of his college
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
for neglecting to furnish the usual essay, or, in the collegiate
phrase, the theme of the week.</p>

<p>'This joint description of ourselves will, we hope, satisfy the
reader without any further information.... We have all the
while gone on, as it were, hand in hand together; and while we
are both employed in furnishing matter for the paper now before
us, we cannot help smiling at our thus making our exit together,
like the two kings of Brentford, smelling at one nosegay.'</p>

<p>Among the few occasional contributors who assisted the originators
of the 'Connoisseur,' the foremost was the Earl of Cork,
who has been noticed as a writer in the 'World.' His communications
to the organ of Mr. Town were the greater part of Nos. 14
and 17, the letters signed 'Goliath English,' in No. 19, great part
of Nos. 33 and 40, and the letters signed 'Reginald Fitzworm,'
'Michael Krawbridge,' 'Moses Orthodox,' and 'Thomas Vainall,'
in Nos. 102, 107, 113, and 129. Duncombe says of this nobleman,
that 'for humour, innocent humour, no one had a truer taste
or better talent.' The authors, in their last paper, acknowledge
the services of their elevated coadjutor in these words:&mdash;'Our
earliest and most frequent correspondent distinguished his favours
by the signature "G. K.," and we are sorry that he will not allow
us to mention his name, since it would reflect as much credit on
our work as we are sure will redound to it from his contributions.'</p>

<p>The Rev. John Duncombe, who has also been noticed as one
of the writers in the 'World,' was a contributor to the 'Connoisseur.'
The concluding paper already quoted observes in
reference to the communications of this writer:&mdash;'The next in
priority of time is a gentleman of Cambridge, who signed himself
"A. B.," and we cannot but regret that he withdrew his assistance,
after having obliged us with the best part of the letters in Nos. 46,
49, and 52, and of the essays in Nos. 62 and 64.'</p>

<p>Of the remaining essayists concerned in this work, William
Cowper, the author of the 'Task,' is the only contributor whose
name has been recovered, and his assistance certainly sheds
an additional interest on the paper. In early life this gifted
poet is said to have formed an acquaintance with Colman
and his colleague; and to this circumstance we owe the few
papers in the 'Connoisseur' which can be positively ascribed to
his pen; No. 119, 'On Keeping a Secret;' No. 134, 'Letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
from Mr. Village on the State of Country Churches, their Clergy
and Congregations;' and No. 138, 'On Conversation.' Other
papers are inferentially attributed, on internal evidence, to the
same author; No. 111, containing the character of the delicate
'Billy Suckling,' and No. 119 are set down to him by Colman and
Thornton. Nos. 13, 23, 41, 76, 81, 105, and 139, although they
cannot be claimed with any degree of certainty for his authorship,
are presumably written by Mr. Village, the cousin of Mr. Town,
whose name is attached to No. 134, which is Cowper's beyond
question.</p>

<p>Robert Lloyd, a minor poet, whose misfortunes in life are in
some degree referred to the temptations held out by his convivial
literary associates, also contributed his lyric compositions to Mr.
Town's paper. He was referred to, at the close of the 'Connoisseur,'
as 'the friend, a member of Trinity College, Cambridge,'
who wrote the song in No. 72, and the verses in Nos. 67, 90, 125,
and 135, all of which pieces were afterwards reprinted with his
other works in the second edition of Johnson's 'Poets.'</p>

<p>'There are still remaining,' concludes Mr. Town, in his final
number, 'two correspondents, who must stand by themselves, as
they wrote to us, not in an assumed character, but <i>in propriâ
personâ</i>. The first is no less a personage than Orator Henley, who
obliged us with that truly original letter printed in No. 37.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
 The
other, who favoured us with a letter no less original, No. 70, we
have reason to believe is a Methodist teacher, and a mechanic;
but we do not know either his name or his trade.'

<p>'A few days ago I was introduced to a young couple who
were but lately married, and are reckoned by all their acquaintance
to be exceedingly happy in each other. I had scarce
saluted the bride, when the husband caught her eagerly in his
arms and almost devoured her with kisses. When we were seated,
they took care to place themselves close to each other, and during
our conversation he was constantly fiddling with her fingers,
tapping her cheek, or playing with her hair. At dinner, they were
mutually employed in pressing each other to taste of every dish,
and the fond appellations of "My dear," "My love," &amp;c., were
continually bandied across the table. Soon after the cloth was
removed, the lady made a motion to retire, but the husband
prevented the compliments of the rest of the company by saying,
"We should be unhappy without her." As the bottle went round,

<p>'I hope it will not be imputed to envy or malevolence that I
here remark on the sign hung out before the productions of Mr.
FitzAdam. When he gave his paper the title of the "World," I
suppose he meant to intimate his design of describing that part of
it who are known to account all other persons "Nobody," and
are therefore emphatically called the "World." If this was to
be pictured out in the head-piece, a lady at her toilette, a party
at whist, or the jovial member of the <i>Dilettanti</i> tapping the world
for champagne, had been the most natural and obvious hieroglyphics.
But when we see the portrait of a philosopher poring on
the globe, instead of observations on modern life, we might more
naturally expect a system of geography, or an attempt towards a
discovery of the longitude.</p>

<p>'Yet, in spite of all these disadvantages, the love of pleasure,
and a few supernumerary guineas, draw the student from his
literary employment, and entice him to this theatre of noise and
hurry, this grand mart of luxury; where, as long as his purse can
supply him, he may be as idle and debauched as he pleases. I
could not help smiling at a dialogue between two of these gentlemen,
which I overheard a few nights ago at the Bedford Coffee-house.
"Ha! Jack," says one, accosting the other, "is it you?
How long have you been in town?" "Two hours." "How long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
do you stay?" "Ten guineas; if you'll come to Venable's after
the play is over, you'll find Tom Latin, Bob Classic, and two or
three more, who will be very glad to see you. What, you're in
town upon the sober plan at your father's? But hark ye, Frank,
if you'll call in, I'll tell your friend Harris to prepare for you. So
your servant; for I'm going to meet the finest girl upon town in
the <i>green-boxes</i>."'</p>

<p>The editor has been turning over that part of Lord Bolingbroke's
works in which he argues that Moses made the animals
accountable for their actions, and that they ought to be treated as
moral agents.</p>

<p>'These reflections were continued afterwards in my sleep;
when methought such proceedings were common in our courts of
judicature. I imagined myself in a spacious hall like the Old
Bailey, where they were preparing to try several animals, who had
been guilty of offences against the laws of the land.</p>

<p>'The sessions soon opened, and the first prisoner that was
brought to the bar was a hog, who was prosecuted at the suit of
the Jews, on an indictment for burglary, in breaking into the synagogue.
As it was apprehended that religion might be affected by
this cause, and as the prosecution appeared to be malicious, the
hog, though the fact was plainly proved against him, to the great
joy of all true Christians, was allowed Benefit of Clergy.</p>

<p>'An indictment was next brought against a cat for killing a
favourite canary-bird. This offender belonged to an old woman,
who was believed by the neighbourhood to be a
witch. The jury, therefore, were unanimous in
their opinion that she was the devil in that shape,
and brought her in guilty. Upon which the judge
formally pronounced sentence upon her, and, I remember,
concluded with these words:&mdash;"You
must be carried to the place of execution, where
you are to be hanged by the neck nine times, till you are dead,
dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead; and the fiddlers

<p>'A parrot was next tried for <i>scandalum magnatum</i>. He was

aldermen for defaming them, as they passed along the street, on a
public festival, by singing, "Room for cuckolds, here comes a
great company; room for cuckolds, here comes my Lord Mayor."
He had even the impudence to abuse the whole court, by calling
the jury rogues and rascals; and frequently interrupted my lord
judge in summing up the evidence, by crying out, "You dog!"
The court, however, was pleased to show mercy to him upon the
petition of his mistress, a strict Methodist; who gave bail for his
good behaviour, and delivered him over to Mr. Whitefield, who
undertook to make a thorough convert of him.'</p>

<p class="center">'<i>To Mr. Town.</i></p>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;I received last week a dinner-card
from a friend, with an intimation that I
should meet some very agreeable ladies. At
my arrival I found that the company consisted
chiefly of females, who indeed did me
the honour to rise, but quite disconcerted me
in paying my respects by whispering to each
other, and appearing to stifle a laugh. When
I was seated, the ladies grouped themselves up in a corner, and
entered on a private cabal, seemingly to discourse upon points of
great secrecy and importance, but of equal merriment and diversion.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-389.jpg" width="112" height="122" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'It was a continued laugh and whisper from the beginning to
the end of dinner. A whole sentence was scarce ever spoken
aloud. Single words, indeed, now and then broke forth; such as
"odious, horrible, detestable, shocking, humbug."</p>

<p>'This last new-coined expression, which is only to be found in
the nonsensical vocabulary, sounds absurd and disagreeable whenever
it is pronounced; but from the mouth of a lady it is "shocking,
detestable, horrible, and odious."</p>

<p>'Thus the whole behaviour of these ladies is in direct contradiction
to good manners. They laugh when they should cry, are
loud when they should be silent, and are silent when their conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
is desirable. If a man in a select company was thus to
laugh or whisper me out of countenance, I should be apt to construe
it as an affront, and demand an explanation. As to the
ladies, I would desire them to reflect how much they would suffer
if their own weapons were turned against them, and the gentlemen
should attack them with the same arts of laughing and whispering.
But, however free they may be from our resentment, they are still
open to ill-natured suspicions. They do not consider what strange
constructions may be put on these laughs and whispers. It were,
indeed, of little consequence if we only imagined that they were
taking the reputations of their acquaintance to pieces, or abusing
the company around; but when they indulge themselves in this
behaviour, some, perhaps, may be led to conclude that they are
discoursing upon topics which they are ashamed to speak of in a
less private manner.'</p>

to Venus as well as Ceres and Liber; and you may frequently
see the jolly messmates of both sexes go in and come out

houses are equally indebted for their support to the cook and that
worthy personage whom they have dignified with the title of procurer.
These gentlemen contrive to play into each other's hands.
The first, by his high soups and rich sauces, prepares the way for
the occupation of the other; who, having reduced the patient by
a proper exercise of his art, returns him back again to go through
the same regimen as before. We may therefore suppose that the
culinary arts are no less studied here than at White's or Pontac's.
True geniuses in eating will continually strike out new improvements;
but I dare say neither of the distinguished chiefs of these
clubs ever made up a more extraordinary dish than I once remember
at the "Castle." Some bloods being in company with a celebrated
<i>fille de joie</i>, one of them pulled off her shoe, and in excess
of gallantry filled it with champagne, and drank it off to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
health. In this delicious draught he was immediately pledged by
the rest, and then, to carry the compliment still further, he ordered
the shoe itself to be dressed and served up for supper. The cook
set himself seriously to work upon it; he pulled the upper part
(which was of damask) into fine shreds, and tossed it up in a
ragout; minced the sole, cut the wooden heel into very thin
slices, fried them in batter, and placed them round the dish for
garnish. The company, you may be sure, testified their affection
for the lady by eating very heartily of this exquisite <i>impromptu</i>;
and as this transaction happened just after the French King had
taken a cobbler's daughter for his mistress, Tom Pierce (who has
the style as well as art of a French cook) in his bill politely called
it, in honour of her name, <i>De Soulier à la Murphy</i>.</p>

while the humbler chop-houses are designed only to satisfy the

see the hearty lovers of beef-steak and gill ale; and at Betty's, and
the chop-houses about the Inns of Court, a pretty maid is as
inviting as the provisions. In these common refectories you may
always find the Jemmy attorney's
clerk, the prim curate, the walking
physician, the captain upon half-pay,
the shabby <i>valet de chambre</i>
upon board wages, and the foreign
count or marquis in dishabille, who
has refused to dine with a duke or
an ambassador. At a little eating-house
in a dark alley behind the
'Change, I once saw a grave citizen, worth a plum, order a twopenny
mess of broth with a boiled chop in it; and when it was
brought him, he scooped the crumb out of a halfpenny roll, and
soaked it in the porridge for his present meal; then carefully
placing the chop between the upper and under crust, he wrapt it
up in a checked handkerchief, and carried it off for the morrow's
repast.'

<p>'The amusement of boxing, I must confess, is more immediately
calculated for the vulgar, who can have no relish for the
more refined pleasures of whist and the
hazard table. Men of fashion have found
out a more genteel employment for their
hands in shuffling a pack of cards and
shaking the dice; and, indeed, it will
appear, upon a strict review, that most of
our fashionable diversions are nothing else
but different branches of gaming. What lady would be able to
boast a rout at her house consisting of three or four hundred
persons, if they were not to be drawn together by the charms of
playing a rubber? and the prohibition of our jubilee masquerades
is hardly to be regretted, as they wanted the most essential part of
their entertainments&mdash;the E. O. table. To this polite spirit of
gaming, which has diffused itself through all the fashionable world,
is owing the vast encouragement that is given to the turf; and
horse races are esteemed only as they afford occasion for making
a bet. The same spirit likewise draws the knowing ones together
in a cockpit; and cocks are rescued from the dunghill, and armed
with gaffles, to furnish a new species of gaming. For this reason,
among others, I cannot but regret the loss of our elegant amusements
in Oxford Road and Tottenham Court. A great part of
the spectators used to be deeply interested in what was doing on
the stage, and were as earnest to make an advantage of the issue
of the battle as the champions themselves to draw the largest
sum from the box. The amphitheatre was at once a school for
boxing and gaming. Many thousands have depended upon a
match; the odds have often risen at a black eye; a large bet has
been occasioned by a "cross-buttock;" and while the house has
resounded with the lusty bangs of the combatants, it has at the
same time echoed with the cries of "Five to one! six to one! ten
to one!"'

<p>'I have observed that the tragedians of the last age studied
<i>fine</i> speaking, in consequence of which all their action consisted
in little more than strutting with one leg before the other, and
waving one or both arms in a continual see-saw. Our present
actors have, perhaps, run into a contrary extreme; their gestures
sometimes resemble those afflicted with St. Vitus's dance, their
whole frame appears to be convulsed, and I have seen a player in
the last act so miserably distressed that a deaf spectator would be
apt to imagine he was complaining of the colic or the toothache.
This has also given rise to that unnatural custom of throwing the
body into various strange <i>attitudes</i>. There is not a passion necessary
to be expressed but has produced dispositions of the limbs
not to be found in any of the paintings or sculptures of the best
masters. A graceful gesture and easy deportment is, indeed,
worthy the care of every performer;
but when I observe
him writhing his body into
more unnatural contortions
than a tumbler at Sadler's
Wells, I cannot help being
disgusted to see him "imitate
humanity so abominably."
Our pantomime authors
have already begun to
reduce our comedies into grotesque scenes; and, if this taste for
<i>attitude</i> should continue to be popular, I would recommend it to
those ingenious gentlemen to adapt our best tragedians to the
same use, and entertain us with the jealousy of Othello in dumb
show or the tricks of Harlequin Hamlet.

</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Preface to the 'Rambler.'</span></p>

<p>When, says Dr. Chalmers, Dr. Johnson undertook to write this
justly celebrated paper, he had many difficulties to encounter. If
lamenting that, during the long period which had elapsed since
the conclusion of the writings of Addison, vice and folly had
begun to recover from depressing contempt, he wished again to
rectify public taste and manners&mdash;to 'give confidence to virtue
and ardour to truth'&mdash;he knew that the popularity of these
writings had constituted them a precedent which his genius was
incapable of following, and from which it would be dangerous to
depart. In the character of an essayist he was, hitherto, unknown
to the public. He had written nothing by which a favourable
judgment could be formed of his success in a species of composition
which seemed to require the ease, the vivacity, and humour
of polished life; and he had probably often heard it repeated
that Addison and his colleagues had anticipated all the subjects
fit for popular essays; that he might, indeed, aim at varying or
improving what had been said before, but could stand no chance
of being esteemed an original writer, or of striking the imagination
by new and unexpected reflections and incidents. He was likewise,
perhaps, aware that he might be reckoned what he about
this time calls himself&mdash;'a retired and uncourtly scholar,' unfit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
describe, because precluded from the observation of, refined
society and manners.</p>

<p>But they who pride themselves on long and accurate knowledge
of the world are not aware how little of that knowledge is
necessary in order to expose vice or detect absurdity; nor can
they believe that evidence far short of ocular demonstration is
amply sufficient for the purposes of the wit and the novelist. Dr.
Johnson appeared in the character of a moral teacher, with powers
of mind beyond the common lot of man, and with a knowledge
of the inmost recesses of the human heart such as never was displayed
with more elegance or stronger conviction. Though in
some respects a recluse, he had not been an inattentive observer
of human life; and he was now of an age at which probably as
much is known as can be known, and at which the full vigour of
his faculties enabled him to divulge his experience and his observations
with a certainty that they were neither immature nor fallacious.
He had studied, and he had noted on the varieties of human
character; and it is evident that the lesser improprieties of conduct
and errors of domestic life had often been the subjects of his secret
ridicule.</p>

<p>Previously to the commencement of the 'Rambler' he had
drawn the outlines of many essays, of which specimens may be
seen in the biographies of Sir John Hawkins and Boswell; and it
is probable that the sentiments of all these papers had been
long floating in his mind. With such preparation he began the
'Rambler,' without any communication with his friends or desire
of assistance. Whether he proposed the scheme himself does
not appear; but he was fortunate in forming an engagement with
Mr. John Payne, a bookseller in Paternoster Row (and afterwards
the chief accountant of the Bank of England), a man with whom
he lived many years in habits of friendship, and who, on the
present occasion, treated his author with liberality. He engaged
to pay two guineas for each paper, or four guineas per week,
which, at that time, must have been to Johnson a very considerable
sum; and he admitted him to a share of the future profits
of the work when it should be collected into volumes, which share
Johnson afterwards sold. It has been observed that objections
have been offered to the name 'Rambler.' Johnson's account to
Sir Joshua Reynolds forms, probably, as good an excuse as so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
trifling a circumstance demands. 'What <i>must</i> be done, sir, <i>will</i>
be done. When I was to begin publishing that paper, I was at a
loss how to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside, and
resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title.
The "Rambler" seemed the best that occurred, and I took it.'
The Italians have literally translated this name '<i>Il Vagabondo</i>.'</p>

<p>The first paper was published on Tuesday, March 20, 1749-50,
and the work continued without the least interruption every Tuesday
and Saturday until Saturday, March 14, 1752, on which day it
closed. Each number was handsomely printed on a sheet and a
half of fine paper, at the price of twopence, and with great typographical
accuracy, not above a dozen errors occurring in the
whole work&mdash;a circumstance the more remarkable, because the
copy was written in haste, as the time urged, and sent to the press
without being revised by the author. When we consider that, in
the whole progress of the work, the sum of assistance he received
scarcely amounted to five papers, we must wonder at the fertility
of a mind engaged during the same period on that stupendous
labour, the English Dictionary, and frequently distracted by
disease and anguish. Other essayists have had the choice of
their days, and their happy hours, for composition; but Johnson
knew no remission, although he very probably would have been
glad of it, and yet continued to write with unabated vigour, although
even this disappointment might be supposed to have often
rendered him uneasy; and his natural indolence&mdash;not the indolence
of will, but of constitution&mdash;would, in other men, have
palsied every effort. Towards the conclusion there is so little of
that 'falling off' visible in some works of the same kind, that it
might probably have been extended much further, had the encouragement
of the public borne any proportion to its merits.</p>

<p>The assistance Johnson received was very trifling: Richardson,
the novelist, wrote No. 97. The four letters in No. 10 were
written by Miss Mulso, afterwards Mrs. Chapone, who also contributed
the story of 'Fidelia' to the 'Adventurer,' a paper conducted
by Doctors Hawkesworth, Johnson, Thornton, and Warton,
which succeeded the 'Rambler.' No. 30 was written by Miss
Catharine Talbot, and Nos. 44 and 100 were written by Mrs.
Elizabeth Carter.</p>

<p>The 'Rambler' made its way very slowly into the world. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
scholars, all men of taste, saw its excellence at once, and crowded
round the author to solicit his friendship and relieve his anxieties.
It procured him a multitude of friends and admirers among men
distinguished for rank as well as genius, and it constituted a perpetual
apology for that rugged and uncourtly manner which sometimes
rendered his conversation formidable, and, to those who
looked from the book to the man, presented a contrast that would
no doubt frequently excite amazement.</p>

<p>Still, it must be confessed, there were at first many prejudices
against the 'Rambler' to be overcome. The style was new; it
appeared harsh, involved, and perplexed; it required more than a
transitory inspection to be understood; it did not suit those who
run as they read, and who seldom return to a book if the hour it
helped to dissipate can be passed away in more active pleasures.
When reprinted in volumes, however, the sale gradually increased;
it was recommended by the friends of religion and literature as a
book by which a man might learn to think; and the author lived
to see ten large editions printed in England, besides those which
were clandestinely printed in other parts of the kingdom and in
America. Since Johnson's death the number of editions has been
multiplied.</p>

<p>Sir John Hawkins informs us that these essays hardly ever
underwent a Revision before they were sent to the press, and adds:
'The original manuscripts of the "Rambler" have passed through
my hands, and by the perusal of them I am warranted to say, as
was said of Shakespeare by the players of that time, that he <i>never
blotted out a line</i>, and I believe without the retort which Ben Jonson
made to them: "Would he had blotted out a thousand!"'</p>

<p>However, Dr. Johnson's desire to carry his essays, which he
regarded in some degree as his monument to posterity, as near
perfection as his labours could achieve, induced him to devote
such attention to the preparation of the 'Ramblers' for the
collected series that the alterations in the second and third editions
far exceed six thousand&mdash;a number which may perhaps justify the
use of the expression 're-wrote,' although it must not be taken in
its literal acceptation.</p>

<p>With respect to the plan of the 'Rambler,' Dr. Johnson may
surely be said to have executed what he intended: he has successfully
attempted the propagation of truth, and boldly maintained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
the dignity of virtue. He has accumulated in this work a treasury
of moral science which will not be soon exhausted. He has
laboured to refine our language to grammatical purity, and to
clear it from colloquial barbarisms, licentious idioms, and irregular
combinations. Something he has certainly added to the
elegance of its construction, and something to the harmony of its
cadence.</p>

<p>Comparisons have been formed between the 'Rambler' and
its predecessors, or rather between the genius of Johnson and
Addison, but have generally ended in discovering a total want of
resemblance. As they were both original writers, they must be
tried, if tried at all, by laws applicable to their respective attributes.
But neither had a predecessor. We find no humour like
Addison's, no energy and dignity like Johnson's. They had
nothing in common but moral excellence of character; they could
not have exchanged styles for an hour. Yet there is one respect
in which we must give Addison the preference&mdash;more general
utility. His writings would have been understood at any period;
Johnson's are more calculated for an improved and liberal education.
In both, however, what was peculiar was natural. The
earliest of Dr. Johnson's works confirm this; from the moment he
could write at all he wrote in stately periods, and his conversation
from first to last abounded in the peculiarities of his composition.</p>

<p>Addison principally excelled in the observation of manners,
and in that exquisite ridicule he threw on the minute improprieties
of life. Johnson, although not ignorant of life or manners, could
not descend to familiarities with tuckers and commodes, with furs
and hoop-petticoats. A scholarly professor and a writer from
necessity, he loved to bring forward subjects so near and dear as
the disappointments of authors&mdash;the dangers and miseries of
literary eminence&mdash;anxieties of literature&mdash;contrariety of criticism&mdash;miseries
of patronage&mdash;value of fame&mdash;causes of the contempt
of the learned&mdash;prejudices and caprices of criticism&mdash;vanity
of an author's expectations&mdash;meanness of dedications&mdash;necessity
of literary courage, and all those other subjects which
relate to authors and their connection with the public. Sometimes
whole papers are devoted to what may be termed the personal
concerns of men of literature, and incidental reflections are everywhere
interspersed for the instruction or caution of the same class.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span></p>

<p>When he treats of common life and manners it has been
observed he gives to the lowest of his correspondents the same
style and lofty periods; and it may also be noticed that the
ridicule he attempts is in some cases considerably heightened by
the very want of accommodation of character. Yet it must be
allowed that the levity and giddiness of coquettes and fine ladies
are expressed with great difficulty in the Johnsonian language.
It has been objected also that even the names of his ladies have
very little of the air of either court or city, as Zosima, Properantia,
&amp;c. Every age seems to have its peculiar names of fiction. In
the 'Spectators,' 'Tatlers,' &amp;c., the Damons and Phillises, the
Amintors and Claras, &amp;c., were the representatives of every virtue
and folly.</p>

<p>These were succeeded by the Philamonts, Tenderillas, Timoleons,
Seomanthes, Pantheas, Adrastas, and Bellimantes, names to
which Mrs. Heywood gave currency in her 'Female Spectator,'
and from which at no great distance of time Dr. Johnson appears
to have taken his Zephyrettas, Trypheruses, Nitellas, Misotheas,
Vagarios, and Flirtillas.</p>

<p class="center">VOL. I., 1750.</p>

<p class="center">'<i>To the "Rambler."</i></p>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;As you seem to have devoted your labours to virtue, I
cannot forbear to inform you of one species of cruelty with which
the life of a man of letters perhaps does not often make him
acquainted, and which, as it seems to produce no other advantage
to those that practise it than a short gratification of thoughtless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
vanity, may become less common when it has been once exposed
in its various forms, and in full magnitude.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-400.jpg" width="277" height="352" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'I am the daughter of a country gentleman, whose family is
numerous, and whose state, not at first sufficient to supply us with
affluence, has been lately so impaired by an unsuccessful lawsuit,
that all the younger children are obliged to try such means as
their education affords them for procuring the necessaries of life.
Distress and curiosity concurred to bring me to London, where I
was received by a relation with the coldness which misfortune
generally finds. A week&mdash;a long week&mdash;I lived with my cousin
before the most vigilant inquiry could procure us the least hopes
of a place, in which time I was much better qualified to bear all
the vexations of servitude. The first two days she was content to
pity me, and only wished I had not been quite so well bred; but
people must comply with their circumstances. This lenity, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
was soon at an end, and for the remaining part of the week
I heard every hour of the pride of the family, the obstinacy of my
father, and of people better born than myself that were common
servants.</p>

<p>'At last, on Saturday noon, she told me, with very visible
satisfaction, that Mrs. Bombasine, the great silk-mercer's lady,
wanted a maid, and a fine place it would be, for there would be
nothing to do but to clean my mistress's room, get up her linen,
dress the young ladies, wait at tea in the morning, taking care of a
little miss just come from nurse, and then sit down to my needle.
But madam was a woman of great spirit, and would not be contradicted,
and therefore I should take care, for good places are not
easily to be got.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-401.jpg" width="189" height="119" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'With these cautions I waited on Madame Bombasine, of whom
the first sight gave me no ravishing ideas. She was two yards
round the waist, her voice was
at once loud and squeaking,
and her face brought to my
mind the picture of the full
moon. "Are you the young
woman," says she, "that are
come to offer yourself? It is
strange when people of substance
want a servant how
soon it is the town talk. But they know they shall have a bellyful
that live with me. Not like people that live at the other end of
the town, we dine at one o'clock. But I never take anybody
without a character; what friends do you come of?" I then told
her that my father was a gentleman, and that we had been unfortunate.
"A great misfortune indeed to come to me and have
three meals a day! So your father was a gentleman, and you are
a gentlewoman, I suppose&mdash;such gentlewomen!" "Madam, I
did not mean to claim any exemptions; I only answered your
inquiry." "Such gentlewomen! people should set up their children
to good trades, and keep them off the parish. Pray go to
the other end of the town; there are gentlewomen, if they would
pay their debts; I am sure we have lost enough by gentlewomen."
Upon this her broad face grew broader with triumph, and I was
afraid she would have taken me for the pleasure of continuing her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
insult; but happily the next word was, "Pray, Mrs. Gentlewoman,
troop downstairs." You may believe I obeyed her.</p>

<p>'After numerous misadventures of the same description, it was
of no purpose that the refusal was declared by me never to be on
my side; I was reasoning against interest and against stupidity;
and therefore I comforted myself with the hope of succeeding
better in my next attempt, and went to Mrs. Courtly, a very fine
lady, who had routs at her
house, and saw the best company
in town.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-402.jpg" width="178" height="101" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'I had not waited two
hours before I was called up,
and found Mr. Courtly and his
lady at piquet in the height of
good humour. This I looked on as a favourable sign, and stood
at the lower end of the room, in expectation of the common questions.
At last Mr. Courtly called out, after a whisper, "Stand
facing the light, that one may see you." I changed my place, and
blushed. They frequently turned their eyes upon me, and seemed
to discover many subjects of merriment, for at every look they
whispered, and laughed with the most violent agitations of delight.
At last Mr. Courtly cried out, "Is that colour your own, child?"
"Yes," said the lady, "if she has not robbed the kitchen hearth."
It was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of laughter,
and they threw down their cards in hopes of better sport. The
lady then called me to her, and began with affected gravity to
inquire what I could do. "But first turn about, and let us see
your fine shape; well, what are you fit for, Mrs. Mum? You
would find your tongue, I suppose, in the kitchen." "No, no,"
says Mrs. Courtly, "the girl's a good girl yet, but I am afraid a
brisk young fellow, with fine tags on his shoulder&mdash;&mdash;" "Come,
child, hold up your head; what? you have stole nothing." "Not
yet," said the lady; "but she hopes to steal your heart quickly."
Here was a laugh of happiness and triumph, prolonged by the
confusion which I could no longer repress. At last the lady recollected
herself: "Stole? no&mdash;but if I had her I should watch her;
for that downcast eye&mdash;&mdash;Why cannot you look people in the
face?" "Steal!" says her husband, "she would steal nothing
but, perhaps, a few ribbons before they were left off by my lady."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
"Sir," answered I, "why should you, by supposing me a thief,
insult one from whom you have received no injury?" "Insult!"
says the lady; "are you come here to be a servant, you saucy
baggage, and talk of insulting? What will this world come to if a
gentleman may not jest with a servant? Well, such servants!
pray be gone, and see when you will have the honour to be so
insulted again. Servants insulted&mdash;a fine time! Insulted! Get
downstairs, you slut, or the footman shall insult you."'</p>

<p>'There is no observation more frequently made by such as
employ themselves in surveying the conduct of mankind than
that marriage, though the dictate of nature, and the institute of
Providence, is yet very often the cause of misery, and that those
who enter into that state can seldom forbear to express their
repentance, and their envy of those whom either chance or
caution hath withheld from it.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-403.jpg" width="105" height="86" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'One of the first of my acquaintances that resolved to quit the
unsettled, thoughtless condition of a bachelor was Prudentius, a
man of slow parts, but not without knowledge or judgment in
things which he had leisure to consider gradually before he
determined them. This grave considerer found by deep meditation
that a man was no loser by marrying early, even though he
contented himself with a less fortune, for, estimating the exact
worth of annuities, he found that considering
the constant diminution of the value of life,
with the probable fall of the interest of
money, it was not worse to have ten thousand
pounds at the age of two-and-twenty years
than a much larger fortune at thirty; for
many opportunities, says he, occur of improving money which, if a
man misses, he may not afterwards recover.</p>

<p>'Full of these reflections, he threw his eyes about him, not in
search of beauty or elegance, dignity or understanding, but of a
woman with ten thousand pounds. Such a woman, in a wealthy
part of the kingdom, it was not difficult to find; and by artful
management with her father&mdash;whose ambition was to make his
daughter a gentlewoman&mdash;my friend got her, as he boasted to us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
in confidence two days after his marriage, for a settlement of
seventy-three pounds a year less than her fortune might have
claimed, and less than himself would have given if the fools had
been but wise enough to delay the bargain.</p>

<p>'Thus at once delighted with the superiority of his parts and
the augmentation of his fortune, he carried Furia to his own house,
in which he never afterwards enjoyed one hour of happiness. For
Furia was a wretch of mean intellects, violent passions, a strong
voice, and low education, without any sense of happiness but that
which consisted in eating, and counting money. Furia was a
scold. They agreed in the desire of wealth, but with this difference:
that Prudentius was for growing rich by gain, Furia by
parsimony. Prudentius would venture his money with chances
very much in his favour; but Furia, very wisely observing that
what they had was, while they had it, <i>their own</i>, thought all traffic
too great a hazard, and was for putting it out at low interest upon
good security. Prudentius ventured, however, to insure a ship at
a very unreasonable price; but, happening to lose his money, was
so tormented with the clamours of his wife that he never durst try
a second experiment. He has now grovelled seven-and-forty years
under Furia's direction, who never once mentioned him, since his
bad luck, by any other name than that of the "usurer."'</p>

<p>'Among the precepts or aphorisms admitted by general consent
and inculcated by repetition, there is none more famous,
among the masters of ancient wisdom, than
that compendious lesson, <span class="greek" title="Gnôthi seauton">Γνωθι σεαυτον</span>&mdash;<i>Be
acquainted with thyself</i>&mdash;ascribed by some to
an oracle, and others to Chilo of Lacedæmon.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-404.jpg" width="102" height="86" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'We might have had more satisfaction
concerning the original import of this celebrated
sentence, if history had informed us
whether it was uttered as a general instruction to mankind, or as a
particular caution to some private inquirer; whether it was applied
to some single occasion, or laid down as the universal rule of life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span></p>

<p>'The great praise of Socrates is that he drew the wits of
Greece, by his instruction and example, from the vain pursuit of
natural philosophy to moral inquiries, and turned their thoughts
from stars and tides, and matter and motion, upon the various
modes of virtue and relations of life.</p>

<p>'The great fault of men of learning is still that they offend
against this rule, and appear willing to study anything rather than
themselves; for which reason they are often despised by those
with whom they imagine themselves above comparison.</p>

<p>'Eupheues,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
 with great parts of extensive knowledge, has a
clouded aspect and ungracious form, yet it has been his ambition,
from his first entrance into life, to distinguish himself by particularities
in his dress&mdash;to outvie beaus in embroidery, to import
new trimming, and to be foremost in the fashion. Eupheues has
turned on his exterior appearance that attention which would have
always produced esteem had it been fixed upon his mind; and,
though his virtues and abilities have preserved him from the contempt
which he has so diligently solicited, he has at least raised
one impediment to his reputation, since all can judge of his dress,
but few of his understanding, and many who discern that he is a
fop are unwilling to believe that he can be wise.</p>

<p>'There is one instance in which the ladies are particularly unwilling
to observe the rule of Chilo. They are desirous to hide
from themselves the
advance of age, and
endeavour too frequently
to supply
the sprightliness and
bloom of youth by
artificial beauty and
forced vivacity.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-405.jpg" width="247" height="118" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'They hope to
inflame the heart by glances which have lost their fire, or melt
it by laughter which is no longer delicate; they play over airs
which pleased at a time when they were expected only to please,
and forget that airs in time ought to give place to virtues. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
continue to trifle, because they could once trifle agreeably, till
those who shared their early pleasures are withdrawn to more
serious engagements, and are scarcely awakened from their dream
of perpetual youth by the scorn of those whom they endeavour to
rival.'</p>

<p>The 'Rambler' inserts a letter describing how the end of those
ladies whose chief ambition is to please is often missed by absurd
and injudicious endeavours to obtain distinction, and who mistake
cowardice for elegance, and imagine all delicacy consists in refusing
to be pleased. A country gentleman relates the circumstances
of his visit to <i>Anthea</i>, a heiress, whose birth and beauty
render her a desirable match:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Dinner was now over, and the company proposed that we
should pursue our original design of visiting the gardens. Anthea
declared that she could not imagine what pleasure we expected
from the sight of a few green trees and a little gravel, and two or
three pits of clear water; that, for her part, she hated walking till
the cool of the evening, and thought it very likely to rain, and
again wished she had stayed at home. We then reconciled ourselves
to our disappointment, and began to talk on common subjects,
when Anthea told us
since we came to see the gardens
she would not hinder
our satisfaction. We all rose,
and walked through the enclosures
for some time with no
other trouble than the necessity
of watching lest a frog should hop across the way, which, Anthea
told us, would certainly kill her if she should happen to see him.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-406.jpg" width="182" height="99" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Frogs, as it fell out, there were none; but when we were
within a furlong of the gardens Anthea saw some sheep, and heard
the wether clink his bell, which she was certain was not hung
upon him for nothing, and therefore no assurances nor entreaties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
should prevail upon her to go a step further: she was sorry to disappoint
the company, but her life was dearer to her than ceremony.</p>

<p>'We came back to the inn, and Anthea now discovered that
there was no time to be lost in returning, for the night would come
upon us and a thousand misfortunes might happen in the dark.
The horses were immediately harnessed, and Anthea, having
wondered what could seduce her to stay so long, was eager to set
out. But we had now a new scene of terror; every man we saw
was a robber, and we were ordered sometimes to drive hard&mdash;lest
a traveller, whom we saw behind, should overtake us&mdash;and sometimes
to stop, lest we should come up to him who was passing
before us. She alarmed many an honest man by begging him to
spare her life as he passed by the coach, and drew me into fifteen
quarrels with persons who increased her fright by kindly stopping
to inquire whether they could assist us. At last we came home,
and she told her company next day what a pleasant ride she had
been taking.'</p>

<p>'The satisfaction received from pastoral writing not only begins
early, but lasts long; we do not, as we advance into the intellectual
world, throw it away among other childish amusements and
pastimes, but willingly return to it at any hour of indolence and relaxation.
The images of true pastoral have always the power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
exciting delight, because the works of nature, from which they are
drawn, have always the same order and beauty, and continue to
force themselves upon our thoughts, being at once obvious to the
most careless regard and more than adequate to the strongest
reason and severest contemplation. Our inclination to stillness
and tranquillity is seldom much lessened by long knowledge of
the busy and tumultuous part of the world. In childhood we turn
our thoughts to the country as to the origin of pleasure; we recur
to it in old age as a part of rest, and, perhaps, with that secondary
and adventitious gladness which every man feels on reviewing
those places, or recollecting those occurrences, that contribute to
his youthful enjoyments, and bring him back to the prime of life,
when the world was gay with the bloom of novelty, when mirth
wantoned at his side, and hope sparkled before him.'</p>

<p>Parthenia addresses a letter to the 'Rambler' on the subject
of the troubles she suffers from the frivolous desire which
her mother, a widow, has contracted to practise the follies of
youth, the pursuit of which she finds fettered by the presence of
Parthenia, whom she is inclined to regard not as her daughter, but
as a rival dangerous to the admiration which the elder lady would
confine to herself.</p>

<p>After a year of decent mourning had been devoted to deploring
the loss of Parthenia's father&mdash;'All the officiousness of kindness
and folly was busied to change the conduct of the widow.
She was at one time alarmed with censure, and at another fired
with praise. She was told of balls where others shone only
because she was absent, of new comedies to which all the town
was crowding, and of many ingenious ironies by which domestic
diligence was made contemptible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span></p>

<p>'It is difficult for virtue to stand alone against fear on one side
and pleasure on the other, especially when no actual crime is proposed,
and prudence itself can suggest many
reasons for relaxation and indulgence. My
mamma was at last persuaded to accompany
Mrs. Giddy to a play. She was received with
a boundless profusion of compliments, and attended
home by a very fine gentleman. Next
day she was, with less difficulty, prevailed on to
play at Mrs. Gravely's, and came home gay and
lively, for the distinctions that had been paid her awakened her
vanity, and good luck had kept her principles of frugality from
giving her disturbance. She now made her second entrance into
the world, and her friends were sufficiently industrious to prevent
any return to her former life; every morning brought messages of
invitation, and every evening was passed in places of diversion,
from which she for some time complained that she had rather be
absent. In a short time she began to feel the happiness of acting
without control, of being unaccountable for her hours, her expenses,
and her company, and learned by degrees to drop an
expression of contempt or pity at the mention of ladies whose
husbands were suspected of restraining their pleasures or their
play, and confessed that she loved to go and come as she pleased.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-409.jpg" width="89" height="113" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'My mamma now began to discover that it was impossible to
educate children properly at home. Parents could not have them
always in their sight; the society of servants
was contagious; company produced boldness
and spirit; emulation excited industry; and a
large school was naturally the first step into the
open world. A thousand other reasons she
alleged, some of little force in themselves, but
so well seconded by pleasure, vanity, and idleness,
that they soon overcame all the remaining
principles of kindness and piety, and both I and
my brother were despatched to boarding-schools.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-409-copy.jpg" width="88" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'When I came home again, after sundry
vacations, and, with the usual childish alacrity,
was running to my mother's embrace, she stopped
me with exclamations at the suddenness and enormity of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
growth, having, she said, never seen anybody shoot up so much
at my age.</p>

<p>'She was sure no other girls spread at that rate, and she hated
to have children look like women before their time. I was disconcerted,
and retired without hearing anything more than "Nay,
if you are angry, Madam Steeple, you may walk off."</p>

<p>'She had yet the pleasure of dressing me like a child, and I
know not when I should have been thought fit to change my
habit, had I not been rescued by a maiden aunt of my father,
who could not bear to see women in hanging-sleeves, and therefore
presented me with brocade for a gown, for which I should
have thought myself under great obligations, had she not accompanied
her favour with some hints that my mamma might now
consider her age, and give me her earrings, which she had shown
long enough in public places.</p>

<p>'Thus I live in a state of continual persecution only because I
was born ten years too soon, and cannot stop the course of nature
or of time, but am unhappily a woman before my mother can
willingly cease to be a girl. I believe you would contribute to the
happiness of many families if by any arguments, or persuasions,
you could make mothers ashamed of rivalling their children; if
you could show them that though they may refuse to grow wise
they must inevitably grow old, and that the proper solaces of age
are not music and compliments, but wisdom and devotion; that
those who are so unwilling to quit the world will soon be driven
from it; and that it is, therefore, their interest to retire while there
yet remain a few hours for nobler employments.&mdash;I am, &amp;c.,</p>

<p>'It is common to distinguish men by the
names of animals which they are supposed
to resemble. Thus a hero is frequently
termed a lion, and a statesman a fox; an
extortioner gains the appellation of vulture,
and a fop the title of monkey. There
is also among the various anomalies of
character which a survey of the world
exhibits, a species of beings in human form which may be properly
marked out as the screech-owls of mankind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span></p>

<p>'These screech-owls seem to be settled in an opinion that the
great business of life is to complain, and that they were born for
no other purpose than to disturb the happiness of others, to lessen
the little comforts and shorten the short pleasures of our condition,
by painful remembrances of the past, or melancholy prognostics of
the future; their only care is to crush the rising hope, to damp
the kindling transport, and alloy the golden hours of gaiety with
the hateful dross of grief and suspicion.</p>

<p>'I have known Suspirius, the screech-owl, fifty-eight years and
four months, and have never passed an hour with him in which he
has not made some attack upon my quiet. When we were first
acquainted, his great topic was the misery of youth without riches;
and whenever we walked out together, he solaced me with a long
enumeration of pleasures, which, as they were beyond the reach of
my fortune, were without the verge of my desires, and which I
should never have considered as the objects of a wish, had not his
unreasonable representations placed them in my sight.</p>

<p>'Suspirius has, in his time, intercepted fifteen authors on their
way to the stage; persuaded nine-and-thirty merchants to retire
from a prosperous trade for fear of bankruptcy; broke off a hundred
and thirty matches by prognostications of unhappiness; and
enabled the small-pox to kill nineteen ladies by perpetual alarms
of the loss of beauty.</p>

<p>'Whenever my evil star brings us together he never fails to
represent to me the folly of my pursuits, and informs me we are
much older than when we began our acquaintance; that the
infirmities of decrepitude are coming fast upon me; that whatever
I now get I shall enjoy but a little time; that fame is to a man
tottering on the edge of the grave of very little importance; and
that the time is at hand when I ought to look for no other pleasures
than a good dinner and an easy chair.'

<p>Ruricola, who dwells in
the country, is writing
upon the airs which
those, whose pursuits
take them to London,
assume on their return
to their more homely
associates; and he relates
in particular the
pretensions of one

and self-conferred
reputation of
<i>knowing town</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-413.jpg" width="217" height="271" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'My curiosity,' declares
Ruricola, 'has
been most engaged by the recital of his own adventures and
achievements. I have heard of the union of various characters in
single persons, but never met with such a constellation of great
qualities as this man's narrative affords. Whatever has distinguished
the hero, whatever has elevated the wit, whatever has
endeared the lover, are all concentrated in Mr. Frolic, whose life
has, for seven years, been a regular interchange of intrigues,
dangers, and waggeries, and who has distinguished himself in
every character that can be feared, envied, or admired.</p>

<p>'I question whether all the officers in the royal navy can bring
together, from all their journals, a collection of so many wonderful
escapes as this man has known upon the Thames, on which he has
been a thousand times on the point of perishing, sometimes by
the terrors of foolish women in the same boat, sometimes by his
own acknowledged imprudence in passing the river in the dark,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
and sometimes by shooting the bridge, under which he has
encountered mountainous waves and dreadful cataracts.</p>

<p>'Not less has been his temerity by land, nor fewer his hazards.
He has reeled with giddiness on the top of the Monument; he
has crossed the street amidst the rush of coaches; he has been
surrounded by robbers without number; he has headed parties at
the play-house; he has scaled the windows of every toast of whatever
condition; he has been hunted for whole winters by his
rivals; he has slept upon bulks; he has cut chairs; he has bilked
coachmen; he has rescued his friends from bailiffs, and has
knocked down the constable, has bullied the justice, and performed
many other exploits that have filled the town with wonder and
merriment.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-414.jpg" width="333" height="91" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'But yet greater is the fame of his understanding than his
bravery, for he informs us that he is, in London, the established
arbitrator on all points of honour, and the decisive judge of all
performances of genius; that no musical performer is in reputation
till the opinion of Frolic has ratified his pretensions; that the
theatres suspend their sentence till he begins to clap or hiss, in
which all are proud to concur; that no public entertainment has
failed or succeeded but because he opposed or favoured it; that
all controversies at the gaming-table are referred to his determination;
that he adjusts the ceremonial at every assembly, and prescribes
every fashion of pleasure or of dress.</p>

<p>'With every man whose name occurs in the papers of the
day he is intimately acquainted, and there are very few points
either on the state or army of which he has not more or less
influenced the disposal, while he has been very frequently consulted
both upon peace and war.'</p>

<p>Ruricola concludes by inquiring whether Mr. Frolic is really
so well known in London as he pretends, or if he shall denounce
him as an impostor.

<p>'There is nothing more fatal to a man whose business is to
think than to have learned the art of regaling his mind with those
airy gratifications. Other vices
or follies are restrained by
fear, reformed by admonition,
or rejected by conviction,
which the comparison of our
conduct with that of others
may in time produce. But
this invisible riot of the mind,
this secret prodigality of being, is secure from detection and fearless
from reproach. The dreamer retires to his apartments, shuts
out the cares and interruptions of mankind, and abandons himself
to his own fancy; new worlds rise up before him, one image is
followed by another, and a long succession of delights dances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
around him. He is at last called back to life by nature or by
custom, and enters peevish into society because he cannot model
it to his own will. He returns from his idle excursions with the
asperity, though not with the knowledge, of a student, and hastens
again to the same felicity with the eagerness of a man bent upon
the advancement of some favourite science. The infatuation
strengthens by degrees, and, like the poison of opiates, weakens
his powers without any external symptom of malignity.'</p>

them those enjoyments and liberties which are equally open for
all. Yet, if servants were taught to go to church

receiving instruction in a <i>family way</i>, and the rest
in mere friendly conversation, the poor wretches
would infallibly take it into their heads that they

death seems not to contribute more to the reformation
of their associates than any other method of

<p>'The frequency of capital punishments, therefore,
rarely hinders the commission of a crime, but
naturally and commonly prevents its detection, and
is, if we proceed upon prudential principles, chiefly
for that reason to be avoided. Whatever may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
urged by casuists or politicians, the greater part of mankind, as
they can never think that to pick the pocket and to pierce the
heart is equally criminal, will scarcely believe that two malefactors
so different in guilt can be justly doomed to the same punishment;
nor is the necessity of submitting the conscience to human laws
so plainly evinced, so clearly stated, or so generally allowed, but
that the pious, the tender, the just, will always scruple to concur
with the community in an act which their private judgment cannot
approve.'</p>

supposing. I know there are some who would continue blockheads
even on the summit of the Andes and on the peak of
Teneriffe. But let not any man be considered as unimprovable

<p>'Squire Bluster is descended from an ancient family. The
estate which his ancestors immemoriably possessed was much
augmented by Captain
Bluster, who served
under Drake in the
reign of Elizabeth; and
the Blusters, who were
before only petty gentlemen,
have from that
time frequently represented
the shire in parliament,
being chosen
to present addresses and give laws at hunting-matches and
races. They were eminently hospitable and popular till the
father of this gentleman died of an election. His lady went to
the grave soon after him, and left their heir, then only ten years
old, to the care of his grandmother, who would not suffer him to
be controlled, because she could not bear to hear him cry; and
never sent him to school, because she was not able to live without
his company. She taught him, however, very early to inspect the
steward's accounts, to dog the butler from the cellar, and catch
the servants at a junket; so that he was at the age of eighteen a
complete master of all the lower arts of domestic policy, and had
often on the road detected combinations between the coachman
and the ostler.</p>

<p>'Money, in whatever hands, will confer power. Distress will
fly to immediate refuge, without much consideration of remote
consequences. Bluster had, therefore, on coming of age, a
despotic authority in many families, whom he had assisted, on
pressing occasions, with larger sums than they can easily repay.
The only visits that he makes are to those houses of misfortune,
where he enters with the insolence of absolute command, enjoys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
the terrors of the family, exacts their obedience, riots at their
charge, and in the height of his joys insults the father with
menaces and the daughters with scurrilities.</p>

<p>'Such is the life of Squire Bluster; a man in whose power
Fortune has liberally placed the means of happiness, but who has
defeated all her gifts of their end by the depravity of his mind.
He is wealthy without followers; he is magnificent without witnesses;
he hath birth without alliance, and influence without
dignity. His neighbours scorn him as a brute; his dependants
dread him as an oppressor; and he has only the gloomy comfort
of reflecting that if he is hated he is likewise feared.'</p>

<p>The writer, who had been adopted by a rich nabob lately
returned from the Indies, suddenly found himself deprived of the
fortune which it was anticipated would have fallen to his share;
his patron having died without making a will in his protégé's
favour, and thus a fine estate had gone to another branch of the
family.</p>

<p>'It was now my part,' writes the victim of this unexpected
adversity, 'to consider how I should repair the disappointment.
I could not but triumph in my long list of friends, which composed
almost every name that power or knowledge entitled to
eminence, and in the prospect of the innumerable roads to honour
and preferment which I had laid open to myself by the wise use
of temporary riches. I believed nothing necessary but that I
should continue that acquaintance to which I had been so readily
admitted, and which had hitherto been cultivated on both sides
with equal ardour.</p>

<p>'Full of these expectations, I one morning ordered a chair,
with an intention to make my usual circle of morning visits.
Where I first stopped I saw two footmen lolling at the door, who
told me, without any change of posture or collection of countenance,
that their master was at home; and suffered me to open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
the inner door without assistance. I found my friend standing,
and as I was tattling with my former freedom was formally
entreated to sit down, but did not stay to be favoured with any
further condescensions.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-421.jpg" width="299" height="109" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'My next experiment was made at the levée of a statesman,
who received me with an embrace of tenderness, that he might
with more decency publish my change of fortune to the sycophants
about. After he had enjoyed the triumph of condolence he turned
to a wealthy stockjobber, and left me exposed to the scorn of those
who had lately courted my notice and solicited my interest.</p>

<p>'I was then set down at the door of another, who upon my
entrance advised me with great solemnity to think of some settled
provision for life. I left him and hurried away to an old friend,
who professed himself unsusceptible of any impressions from prosperity
or misfortune, and begged that he might see me when he
was more at leisure.</p>

<p>'Of sixty-seven doors at which I knocked in the first week
after my appearance in a mourning dress I was denied admission
at forty-six; was suffered at fourteen to wait in the outer room till
business was despatched; at four was entertained with a few
questions about the weather; at one heard the footman rated for
bringing my name; and at two was informed, in the flow of casual
conversation, how much a man of rank degrades himself by mean
company.</p>

<p>'Such, Mr. Rambler, is the power of wealth, that it commands
the ear of greatness and the eye of beauty; gives spirit to the dull
and authority to the timorous, and leaves him from whom it
departs without virtue and without understanding, the sport of
caprice, the scoff of insolence, the slave of meanness, and the
pupil of ignorance.'

<p>Misella sends her history to the 'Rambler' as a caution to
others who may chance to rely on the fidelity of distant relatives.
Her father becoming burdened with a family larger than his means
could decently provide for, a wealthy relative had offered to take
the charge of one member, the writer, upon himself.</p>

<p>'Without knowing for what purpose I was called to my great
cousin,' says the unhappy Misella, 'I endeavoured to recommend
myself by my best courtesy, sang him my prettiest song, told the
last story that I had read, and so much endeared myself by my
innocence that he declared his resolution to adopt me, and to
educate me with his own daughters.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>'My parents felt the common struggle at the thought of parting,
and <i>some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon</i>. They
considered, not without that false estimation of the value of wealth
which poverty long continued always produces, that I was raised
to higher rank than they could give me, and to hopes of more
ample fortune than they could bequeath. My mother sold some
of her ornaments to dress me in such a manner as might secure
me from contempt at my first arrival, and when she dismissed me
pressed me to her bosom with an embrace which I still feel.</p>

<p>'My sister carried my finery, and seemed not much to regret
our separation; my father conducted me to the stage-coach with a
sort of cheerful tenderness; and in a very short time I was
transported to splendid apartments and a luxurious table, and
grew familiar to show, noise, and gaiety.</p>

<p>'In three years my mother died, having implored a blessing on
her family with her last breath.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span></p>

<p>'I had little opportunity to indulge a sorrow which there was
none to partake with me, and therefore soon ceased to reflect
much upon my loss. My father turned all his care upon his other
children, whom some fortunate adventures and unexpected legacies
enabled him, when he died four years after my mother, to
leave in a condition above their expectations.</p>

<p>'I should have shared the increase of his fortunes and had
once a portion assigned me in his will, but my cousin assuring him
that all care for me was needless, since he had resolved to place
me happily in the world, directed him to divide my part amongst
my sisters.</p>

<p>'Thus I was thrown upon dependence without resource.
Being now at an age in which young women are initiated into
company, I was no longer to be supported in my former character,
but at considerable expense; so that partly lest appearance might
draw too many compliments and assiduities I was insensibly
degraded from my equality, and enjoyed few privileges above the
head servant but that of receiving no wages.'</p>

buy a ticket in the lottery. At last the day came, my ticket
appeared, and rewarded all my care and sagacity with a despicable
prize of fifty pounds.</p>

<p>'My friends, who honestly rejoiced upon my success, were
very coldly received; I hid myself a fortnight in the country that
my chagrin might fume away without observation, and then,
returning to my shop, began to listen after another lottery.

<p>'With the news of a lottery I was soon gratified, and, having
now found the vanity of conjecture and inefficacy of computation,
I resolved to take the prize by violence, and
therefore bought forty tickets, not omitting,
however, to divide them between the even and
the odd, that I might not miss the lucky class.
Many conclusions did I form, and many experiments
did I try, to determine from which of
those tickets I might most reasonably expect
riches. At last, being unable to satisfy myself
by any modes of reasoning, I wrote the numbers
upon dice, and allotted five hours every day to
the amusement of throwing them in a garret;
and examining the event by an exact register,
found, on the evening before the lottery was
drawn, that one of my numbers had turned up
five times more than any of the rest in three
hundred and thirty thousand throws.</p>

<p>'This experiment was fallacious; the first day presented the
ticket a detestable blank. The rest came out with different
fortune, and in conclusion I lost thirty pounds by this great
adventure.</p>

<p>'The prize which had been suffered to slip from me filled me
with anguish, and, knowing that complaint would only expose me
to ridicule, I gave myself up silently to grief, and lost by degrees
my appetite and my rest.'</p>

<p>'The elegance of Ajut's dress, and the judicious disposition of
her ornaments of coral and shells, had such an effect upon
Anningait that he could no longer be restrained from a declaration
of his love. He, therefore, composed a poem in her praise, in
which, among other heroic and tender sentiments, he protested
that, "She was beautiful as the vernal willow, and fragrant as
thyme upon the mountains; that her fingers were white as the
teeth of the morse, and her smile grateful as the dissolution of the
ice; that he would pursue her though she should pass the snows
of the midland cliffs, or seek shelter in the caves of the eastern
cannibals; that he would tear her from the embrace of the genius
of the rocks, snatch her from the paws of Amaroc, and rescue her
from the ravine of Hafgufa."</p>

<p>'This ode being universally applauded, it was expected that
Ajut would soon yield to such fervour and accomplishments; but
Ajut, with the natural haughtiness of beauty, expected all the forms
of courtship; and before she would confess herself conquered the
sun returned, the ice broke, and the season of labour called all to
their employments.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-425.jpg" width="177" height="131" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'It happened that a tempest drove the fish to a distant part of
the coast before Anningait had completed his store; he therefore
entreated Ajut that she would at
last grant him her hand and accompany
him to that part of the
country whither he was now
summoned of necessity. Ajut
thought him not yet entitled to
such condescension, but proposed,
as a trial of constancy,
that he should return at the end
of summer to the cavern where their acquaintance commenced, and
there expect the reward of his assiduities. But Anningait tried to
soften this resolution: he feelingly represented the uncertainty of
existence and the dangers of the passage, and his loneliness when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
distant from the object of his love. "Consider, Ajut," urged he,
"a few summer days, a few winter nights, and the life of man is
at an end. Night is the time of ease and festivity, of revels and
gaiety; but what will be the flaming lamp, the delicious seal, or the
soft oil without the smile of Ajut?"</p>

<p>'The eloquence of Anningait was vain; the maid continued
inexorable, and they parted with ardent promises to meet again
before the night of winter. Anningait, however discomposed by
the dilatory coyness of Ajut, was resolved to omit no tokens of
amorous respect, and therefore presented her at his departure with
the skins of seven white fawns, of five swans, and eleven seals,
with three marble lamps, ten vessels of seal-oil, and a large kettle
of brass which he had purchased from a ship at the price of half a
whale and two horns of sea-unicorns.</p>

<p>'Ajut was so much affected by the fondness of her lover, or so
much overpowered by his munificence, that she followed him to
the seaside; and, when she saw him enter the boat, wished aloud
that he might return with plenty of skins and oil, that neither the
mermaids might snatch him into the deeps, nor the spirits of the
rocks confine him in their caverns.</p>

<p>'Parted from each other, the lovers devoted themselves to the
remembrances of their affection; Anningait devoted himself to
fishing and the chase with redoubled energy, that his stores for the
future might exceed the expectations of his bride; and Ajut
mourned the absence of her betrothed with ceaseless fidelity.
She neglected the ornaments of her person, and, to avoid the
solicitations of her lover's rivals, withdrew herself into complete
seclusion. Thus passed the months of separation. At last Ajut
saw the great boat in which Anningait departed stealing slow and
heavy laden along the coast. She ran with all the impatience of
affection to catch her lover in her arms, and relate her constancy
and sufferings. When the company reached the land they informed
her that Anningait, after the fishery was ended, being
unable to support the slow passage of the vessel of carriage, had
set out before them in his fishing-boat, and they expected at their
arrival to have found him on shore.</p>

<p>'Ajut, distracted at this intelligence, was about to fly into the
hills without knowing why, though she was now in the hands of
her parents, who forced her back to her own hut and endeavoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
to comfort her; but when at last they retired to rest, Ajut went
down to the beach, where, finding a fishing-boat, she entered it
without hesitation, and, telling those who wondered at her rashness
that she was going in search of Anningait, rowed away with great
swiftness and was seen no more.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-427.jpg" width="390" height="156" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'The fate of these lovers gave occasion to various fictions and
conjectures. Some are of opinion that they were changed into
stars; others imagine that Anningait was seized in his passage by
the genius of the rocks, and that Ajut was transformed into a
mermaid, and still continues to seek her lover in the deserts of
the sea. But the general persuasion is that they are both in that
part of the land of souls where the sun never sets, where oil is
always fresh, and provisions always warm. The virgins sometimes
throw a thimble and a needle into the bay from which the hapless
maid departed, and when a Greenlander would praise any couple
for virtuous affection he declares that they love like Anningait and
Ajut.'</p>

<p>'Dear Mr. Rambler,&mdash;I have been four days confined to my
chamber by a cold, which has already kept me from three plays,
nine sales, five shows, and six card-tables, and put me seventeen
visits behind; and the doctor tells my mamma that, if I fret and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
cry, it will settle in my head, and I shall not be fit to be seen these
six weeks. But, dear Mr. Rambler, how can I help it? At this
very time Melissa is dancing with the prettiest gentleman; she
will breakfast with him to-morrow, and then run to two auctions,
and hear compliments, and have presents; then she will be
dressed and visit, and get a ticket to the play, then go to cards,
and win, and come home with two flambeaus before her chair.
Dear Mr. Rambler, who can bear it?</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>'I am at a loss to guess for what purpose they relate such
tragic stories of the cruelty, perfidy, and artifices of men, who, if
they ever were so malicious and destructive, have certainly now
reformed their manners. I have not, since my entrance into the
world, found one who does not profess himself devoted to my
service, and ready to live or die as I shall command him. They
are so far from intending to hurt me that their only contention is,
who shall be allowed most closely to attend and most frequently
to treat me; when different places of entertainment or schemes of
pleasure are mentioned, I can see the eyes sparkle and the cheeks
glow of him whose proposals obtain my approbation; he then
leads me off in triumph, adores my condescension, and congratulates
himself that he has lived to the hour of felicity. Are these,
Mr. Rambler, creatures to be feared? and is it likely that any
injury will be done me by those who can enjoy life only while I
favour them with my presence?</p>

<p>'As little reason can I yet find to suspect them of stratagems
and fraud. When I play at cards they never take advantage of
any mistakes, nor exact from me a rigorous observation of the
game. Even Mr. Shuffle, a grave gentleman, who has daughters
older than myself, plays with me so negligently that I am sometimes
inclined to believe he loses his money by design; and yet
he is so fond of play that he says he will one day take me to his
house in the country, that we may try by ourselves who can
conquer. I have not yet promised him; but when the town grows
a little empty I shall think upon it, for I want some trinkets, like
Letitia's, to my watch. I do not doubt my luck, but I must study
some means of amusing my relations.</p>

<p>'For all these distinctions I find myself indebted to that beauty
which I was never suffered to hear praised, and of which, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
I did not before know the full value. This concealment was
certainly an intentional fraud, for my aunts have eyes like other
people, and I am every day told that nothing but blindness can
escape the influence of my charms. Their whole account of that
world which they pretend to know so well has been only one
fiction entangled with another; and though the modes of life oblige
me to continue some appearances of respect, I cannot think that
they who have been so clearly detected in ignorance or imposture
have any right to the esteem, veneration, or obedience of,</p>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;The curiosity of the present race of philosophers having
been long exercised upon electricity has been lately transferred to
magnetism; the qualities
of the loadstone have been
investigated, if not with
much advantage, yet with
great applause; and, as the
highest praise of art is to
imitate nature, I hope no
man will think the makers
of artificial magnets celebrated
or reverenced above
their deserts.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p>'I have for some time
employed myself in the
same practice, but with deeper knowledge and more extensive
views. While my contemporaries were touching needles and
raising weights, or busying themselves with inclination and
variation, I have been examining those qualities of magnetism
which may be applied to the accommodation and happiness of
common life. I have left to inferior understandings the care of
conducting the sailor through the hazards of the ocean, and
reserved to myself the more difficult and illustrious province of
preserving the connubial compact from violation, and setting
mankind free for ever from the torments of fruitless vigilance and
anxious suspicion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span></p>

<p>'To defraud any man of his due praise is unworthy of a
philosopher. I shall therefore openly confess that I owe the first
hint of this inestimable secret to the Rabbi Abraham Ben Hannase,
who, in his treatise of precious stones, has left this account of the
magnet: "The calamita, or loadstone, that attracts iron, produces
many bad fantasies in man. Women fly from this stone. If,
therefore, any husband be disturbed with jealousy, and fear lest
his wife converses with other men, let him lay this stone upon her
while she is asleep. If she be pure she will, when she wakes,
clasp her husband fondly in her arms; but if she be guilty she will
fall out of bed, and run away."</p>

<p>'With these hopes I shall, in a short time, offer for sale magnets
armed with a particular metallic composition, which concentrates
their virtue and determines their agency.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-431.jpg" width="143" height="151" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'I shall sell them of different sizes, and various degrees of
strength. I have some of a bulk proper to be hung at the bed's
head, as scarecrows, and some so small
that they may be easily concealed.
Some I have ground into oval forms,
to be hung at watches; and some, for
the curious, I have set in wedding rings,
that ladies may never want an attestation
of their innocence. Some I can
produce so sluggish and inert that they
will not act before the third failure,
and others so vigorous and animated
that they exert their influence against
unlawful wishes, if they have been willingly and deliberately indulged.
As it is my practice honestly to tell my customers the
properties of my magnets I can judge by the choice of the delicacy
of their sentiments. Many have been contented to spare
cost by purchasing only the lowest degree of efficacy, and all have
started with terror from those which operate upon the thoughts.
One young lady only fitted on a ring of the strongest energy, and
declared that she scorned to separate her wishes from her acts,
or allow herself to think what she was forbidden to practise.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Preface to the 'Mirror.'</span></p>

<p>The circumstances which led to the publication of the 'Mirror,'
by a certain society of friends in Edinburgh, are set forth in the
concluding paper of that work, No. 110, which originally appeared
May 27, 1780. The dying speech of the Scotch essayist forms a
suitable introduction to the series.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Extremum concede laborem.&mdash;<i>Virg. Ecl.</i> x. 1.</p>
</div></div>
<p>'As, at the close of life, people confess the secrets and explain
the mysteries of their conduct, endeavour to do justice to those
with whom they have had dealings, and to die in peace with all
the world; so in the concluding number of a periodical publication,
it is usual to lay aside the assumed name, or fictitious character,
to ascribe the different papers to their true authors, and to
wind up the whole with a modest appeal to the candour or indulgence
of the public.</p>

<p>'In the course of these papers the author has not often ventured
to introduce himself, or to give an account of his own situation;
in this, therefore, which is to be the last, he has not much
to unravel on that score. From the narrowness of the place of its
appearance, the '<span class="smcap">Mirror</span>' did not admit of much personification
of its editor; the little disguise he has used has been rather to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
conceal what he was than to give himself out for what he was
not.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-433.jpg" width="289" height="453" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'The idea of publishing a periodical paper in Edinburgh took
its rise in a company of gentlemen whom particular circumstances
of connection brought frequently together. Their discourse often
turned upon subjects of manners, of taste, and of literature. By
one of these accidental resolutions, of which the origin cannot
easily be traced, it was determined to put their thoughts into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
writing, and to read them for the entertainment of each other.
Their essays assumed the form, and soon after some one gave
them the name, of a periodical publication; the writers of it were
naturally associated, and their meetings increased the importance
as well as the number of their productions. Cultivating letters in
the midst of business, composition was to them an amusement
only; that amusement was heightened by the audience which this
society afforded; the idea of publication suggested itself as productive
of still higher entertainment.</p>

<p>'It was not, however, without diffidence that such a resolution
was taken. From that and several other circumstances it was
thought proper to observe the strictest secrecy with regard to the
authors; a purpose in which they have been so successful that, at
this very moment, the very publisher of the work knows only one
of their number, to whom the conduct of it was entrusted.'</p>

<p>The members of the society alluded to in the last number of
the 'Mirror' afterwards carried on the 'Lounger.' They were Mr.
R. Cullen, Mr. M'Leod Bannatyne, Mr. George Ogilvy, Mr. Alex.
Abercromby, and Mr. W. Craig, advocates, the last two of whom
were afterwards appointed Judges of the Court of Session in Scotland;
Mr. George Home, one of the principal clerks of that
court; and Mr. H. Mackenzie, of the Exchequer of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Of these Mr. Ogilvy, though with abilities and genius abundantly
capable of the task, never contributed to the 'Mirror,' and
the society had to lament his death before the appearance of the
'Lounger.' None of its members, Mr. Mackenzie excepted,
whose name is sufficiently known as an author, had ever before
been concerned in any publication. To Mr. Mackenzie, therefore,
was entrusted the conducting the work, and he alone had
any communication with the editor, to whom the other members
of the society were altogether unknown. Secrecy was an object
of much importance to a work of this sort; and during the publication
of both these performances it was singularly well attained.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackenzie's papers were the most numerous. He is stated
to have been the author of Nos. 2, 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 16 (the latter
part of 17), 21, 23, 25, 30, 32, 34 (part of 35), 38, 40, 41, 42, 43,
44, 49, 53, 54 (part of 56), 61, 64, 72, 78, 80, 81, 84, the poem in
85 (part of 89), 91, 92, 93 (part of 96), 99, 100, 101 (parts of 102,
103), 105, 107, 108, 109, and 110.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span></p>

<p>The contributions of correspondents were of considerable
assistance to the success of the 'Mirror.' Of these Lord Hailes
was the most industrious; among other promoters we find the
names of Mr. Richardson, Professor of Humanity at Glasgow;
Mr. Fraser Tytler, Advocate and Professor of History in the
University of Edinburgh; Mr. D. Hume, Professor of Scots Laws
at Edinburgh, nephew of the celebrated David Hume; D. Beattie;
Cosmo Gordon, Esq., one of the Barons of Exchequer in Scotland;
Mr. W. Strahan, of London, the King's printer; Mr. Baron
Gordon, &amp;c.</p>

<p>'No child ever heard from its nurse the story of "Jack the
Giant Killer's Cap of Darkness" without envying the pleasures of
invisibility.</p>

<p>'This power is, in some degree, possessed by the writer of an
anonymous paper. He can at least exercise it for a purpose for
which people would be most apt to use the privilege of being
invisible: to wit, that of hearing what is said of himself.</p>

<p>'A few hours after the publication of my first number, I sallied
forth, with all the advantages of invisibility, to hear an account of
myself and my paper.</p>

<p>'A smart-looking young man, in green, said he was sure it
would be very satirical; his companion, in scarlet, was equally
certain that it would be very stupid. But with this last prediction
I was not much offended, when I discovered that its author had
not read the first number, but only inquired of Mr. Creech where
it was published.</p>

<p>'A plump round figure, near the fire, who had just put on his
spectacles to examine the paper, closed the debate by observing,
with a grave aspect, that, as the
author was anonymous, it was
proper to be very cautious in
talking of the performance. After
glancing over the pages, he said
he could have wished they had
set apart a corner for intelligence
from America; but, having taken
off his spectacles, wiped, and put them into their case, he said,
with a tone of discovery, he had found out the reason why there
was nothing of that sort in the "Mirror"&mdash;it was in order to save
the tax upon newspapers.'

<p>The following is an extract from a letter, addressed by a parent
to the editor, on the evil consequences of sending youths to Paris
to finish their education:&mdash;</p>

<p>'When the day of their return came, my girl, who had been
constantly on the look-out, ran to tell me she saw a postchaise
driving to the gate. But, judge of my astonishment when I saw
two pale, emaciated figures get out of the carriage, in their dress
and looks resembling monkeys rather than human creatures.
What was still worse, their manners were more displeasing than
their appearance. When
my daughter ran up, with
tears of joy in her eyes, to
embrace her brother, he
held her from him, and
burst into an immoderate
fit of laughter at something
in her dress that appeared
to him ridiculous. He was joined in the laugh by his
younger brother, who was pleased, however, to say that the girl
was not ill-looking, and, when taught to put on her clothes, and to
use a little <i>rouge</i>, would be tolerable.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-437.jpg" width="216" height="102" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Mortified as I was at this impertinence, the partiality of a
parent led me to impute it, in a great measure, to the levity
of youth; and I still flattered myself that matters were not so
bad as they appeared to be. In these hopes I sat down to dinner.
But there the behaviour of the young gentlemen did not, by any
means, tend to lessen my chagrin. There was nothing at table
they could eat; they ran out in praise of French cookery, and
seemed even to be adepts in the science; they knew the component
ingredients of most fashionable <i>ragoûts</i> and <i>fricandeaus</i>,
and were acquainted with the names and characters of the most
celebrated practitioners of the art in Paris.</p>

<p>'In short, it was found these unfortunate youths had returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
ignorant of everything they ought to know, their minds corrupted,
their bodies debilitated, and their vanity and conceit making them

<p>Mr. Fleetwood, a man of excessive refinement and delicacy
of taste, is described as paying visits to his friends in the country.
But the pleasures which might possibly be derived from this
exercise are marred by his false sensibility.</p>

<p>'Our next visit was to a gentleman of liberal education and
elegant manners, who, in the earlier part of his life, had been
much in the polite world. Here Mr. Fleetwood expected to find
pleasure and enjoyment sufficient to atone for his two previous
experiences which were far from agreeable; but here, too, he was
disappointed.</p>

<p>'Mr. Selby, for that was our friend's name, had been several
years married. His family increasing, he had retired to the
country, and, renouncing the bustle of the world, had given himself
up to domestic enjoyments; his time and attention were
devoted chiefly to the care of his children. The pleasure which
he himself felt in humouring all their little fancies made him forget
how troublesome that indulgence might be to others.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-438.jpg" width="211" height="94" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'The first morning we were at his house, when Mr. Fleetwood
came into the parlour to breakfast, all the places at table were
occupied by the children;
it was necessary that one
of them should be displaced
to make room for him;
and, in the disturbance
which this occasioned, a
teacup was overturned, and
scalded the finger of Mr.
Selby's eldest daughter, a child about seven years old, whose
whimpering and complaining attracted the whole attention during
breakfast. That being over, the eldest boy came forward with a
book in his hand, and Mr. Selby asked Mr. Fleetwood to hear
him read his lesson. Mrs. Selby joined in the request, though
both looked as if they were rather conferring a favour on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
guest. The eldest had no sooner finished, than the youngest boy
presented himself; upon which his father observed that it would
be doing injustice to Will not to hear him as well as his elder
brother Jack, and in this way was my friend obliged to spend the
morning in performing the office of a schoolmaster to the children
in succession.</p>

<p>'Mr. Fleetwood liked a game at whist, and promised himself
a party in the evening, free from interruption. Cards were accordingly
proposed, but Mrs. Selby observed that her little daughter,
who still complained of her scalded finger, needed amusement as
much as any of the company. In place of cards, Miss Harriet
insisted on the "game of the goose." Down to it we sat, and to a
stranger it would have been not unamusing to see Mr. Fleetwood,
with his sorrowful countenance, at the "royal and pleasant game
of the goose," with a child of seven years old. It is unnecessary
to dwell longer on particulars. During all the time we were at

<p>A wife is writing to the 'Mirror' upon a new affliction which
has attacked her husband. He happened to receive a crooked
shilling in exchange for some of his goods (the husband was a
grocer), and a virtuoso informed him that it was a coin of Alexander
III., of great rarity and value, whereupon the good man became
seized with a passion for collecting curiosities.</p>

<p>'His taste,' says the wife's letter, 'ranges from heaven above
to the earth beneath, and to the waters under the earth. Every
production of nature or of art, remarkable either for beauty or
deformity, but particularly if either <i>scarce</i> or <i>old</i>, is now the object
of my husband's avidity. The profits of our business, once considerable,
but now daily diminishing, are expended, not only on
coins, but on shells, lumps of different coloured stones, dried
butterflies, old pictures, ragged books, and worm-eaten parchments.</p>

<p>'Our house, which it was once my highest pleasure to keep in
order, it would be now equally vain to attempt cleaning as the ark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
of Noah. The children's bed is supplied by an Indian canoe;
and the poor little creatures sleep three of them in a hammock,
slung up to the roof between a <i>stuffed crocodile</i> and the skeleton of
a <i>calf with two heads</i>. Even the commodities of our shop have
been turned out to make room for trash and vermin. <i>Kites</i>, <i>owls</i>,
and <i>bats</i> are perched upon the top of our shelves; and it was but
yesterday that, putting my hand into a glass jar that used to
contain pickles, I laid hold of a large <i>tarantula</i> in place of a
mangoe.</p>

<p>'In the bitterness of my soul, Mr. Mirror, I have been often
tempted to revenge myself on the objects of my husband's phrenzy,
by burning, smashing, and destroying them without mercy; but,
besides that such violent procedure might have effects too dreadful
upon a brain which, I fear, is already much unsettled, I could not
take such a course without being guilty of a fraud to our creditors,
several of whom will, I believe, sooner or later, find it their only
means of reimbursement to take back each man his own monsters.'</p>

<p>The 'Mirror' prints a letter upon the grievances felt
by the families of men of small fortunes when associated
with those enjoying great ones.</p>

<p>'You will remember, sir, my account of a visit
which my daughters paid to a great lady in our
neighbourhood, and of the effects which that visit
had upon them. I was beginning to hope that time,
and the sobriety of manners which home exhibited, would restore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
them to their former situation, when, unfortunately, a circumstance
happened still more fatal to me than their expedition to &mdash;&mdash;.
This, sir, was the honour of a visit from the great lady in return.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-441.jpg" width="314" height="219" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'I was just returning from the superintendence of my ploughs,
in a field I have lately enclosed, when I was met, on the green
before my door, by a gentleman (for such I took him to be)
mounted upon a very handsome gelding, who asked me, by the
appellation of <i>honest friend</i>, if this was not Mr. Homespun's; and,
in the same breath, whether the ladies were at home. I told him
my name was Homespun, the house was mine, and my wife and
daughters were, I believed, within. Upon this, the young man,
pulling off his hat, and begging my pardon for calling me <i>honest</i>,
said he was despatched by Lady &mdash;&mdash;, with her compliments, to
Mrs. and Misses Homespun, and that, if convenient, she intended
herself the honour of dining with them, on her return from B&mdash;&mdash;
Park (the seat of another great and rich lady in our neighbourhood).</p>

<p>'I confess, Mr. Mirror, I was struck somewhat of a heap with
the message; and it would not, in all probability, have received
an immediate answer, had it not been overheard by my eldest
daughter, who had come to the window on the appearance of a
stranger.</p>

<p>'"Mr. Papillot," said she, immediately, "I rejoice to see you;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
I hope your lady and all the family are well." "Very much at
your service, ma'am," he replied, with a low bow; "my lady sent
me before, with the offer of her best compliments, and that, if
convenient"&mdash;and so forth, repeating his words to me. "She
does us infinite honour," said my young madam; "let her ladyship
know how happy her visit will make us; but, in the meantime,
Mr. Papillot, give your horse to one of the servants, and
come in and have a glass of something after your ride." "I am
afraid," answered he (pulling out his right-hand watch, for, would
you believe it, sir, the fellow had one in each fob), "I shall hardly
have time to meet my lady at the place she appointed me." On a
second invitation, however, he dismounted, and went into the
house, leaving his horse to the care of the servants; but the
servants, as my daughter very well knew, were all in the fields at
work; so I, who have a liking for a good horse, and cannot bear
to see him neglected, had the honour of putting Mr. Papillot's
horse in the stable myself.'</p>

<p>The arrival of the distinguished party completely upset Mr.
Homespun's establishment, turned the heads of his entire family,
and annihilated the effect of all his good teachings.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">The 'Mirror.'</span>&mdash;Vol. I. No. 50.</p>

<p>'It was formerly one of those national boasts which are always
allowable, and sometimes useful, that the ladies of Scotland possessed
a purity of conduct and delicacy of manners beyond that of
most other countries. Free from the bad effects of overgrown
fortunes, and from the dissipated society of an overgrown capital,
their beauty was natural and their minds were uncorrupted.</p>

<p>'Formerly a London journey was attended with some difficulty
and danger, and posting thither was an achievement as masculine
as a fox-chase. Now the goodness of the roads and the convenience
of the vehicles render it a matter of only a few days' moderate
exercise for a lady; <i>Facilis descensus Averni</i>; our wives and
daughters are carried thither to see the world, and we are not to
wonder if some of them bring back only that knowledge of it
which the most ignorant can acquire and the most forgetful retain.
That knowledge is communicated to a certain circle on their
return; the imitation is as rapid as it is easy; they emulate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
English, who before have copied the French; the dress, the
phrase, and the <i>morale</i> of Paris is transplanted first to London,
and thence to Edinburgh; and even the sequestered regions of the
country are sometimes visited in this northern progress of politeness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-445.jpg" width="227" height="148" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'It will be said, perhaps, that there is often a levity of
behaviour without any criminality of conduct; that the lady who
talks always loud, and sometimes free, goes much abroad, or
keeps a crowd of company at home, rattles in a public place with
a circle of young fellows, or flirts in a corner with a single one,
does all this without the smallest bad intention, merely as she
puts on a cap and sticks it with feathers because she has seen it
done by others whose rank and fashion entitle them to her imitation.'</p>

<p>Sit mihi fas audita loqui.</p>
</div></div>
<p>'Passing the Exchange a few days ago, I perceived a little
before me a short, plump-looking man, seeming to set his watch
by St. Giles's clock, which had just
then struck two. On observing him
more closely, I recognised Mr.
Blubber, with whom I had been acquainted
at the house of our mutual
friend Mr. Bearskin.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-445-copy.jpg" width="159" height="106" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'He recollected me, and, shaking
me cordially by the hand, told me
he was just returned safe from his
journey to the Highlands, and had been regulating his watch by
our town clock, as he found the sun did not go exactly in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
Highlands as it did in the Low country. He added, that if I
would come and eat a Welsh rare-bit and drink a glass of punch
with him and his family that evening, at their lodgings hard by,
they would give me an account of their expedition.</p>

<p>'When I went to their lodgings in the evening, I could not
help making one preliminary observation, that it was much too
early in the season for visiting the country to advantage; but to
this Mr. Blubber had a very satisfactory answer: they were resolved
to complete their tour before the new tax upon post-horses should
be put in execution.</p>

<p>'The first place they visited after they left Edinburgh was
Carron, which Mr. Blubber seemed to prefer to any place he had
seen; but the ladies did not appear to have relished it much.
The mother said, "She was like to have fell into a fit at the noise
of the great bellows." Miss Blubber agreed that it was <i>monstrous</i>
frightful indeed. Miss Betsy had spoiled her petticoat in getting
in, and said it was a nasty place, not fit for genteel people, in her
opinion. Blubber put on his wisest face, and observed that
women did not know the use of them things. There was much
the same difference in their sentiments with regard to the Great
Canal. Mr. Blubber took out a piece of paper, on which he
had marked down the <i>lockage duty</i> received in a week there; he
shook his head, however, and said he was sorry to find the shares
<i>below par</i>.</p>

<p>'Taymouth seemed to strike the whole family. The number
and beauty of the temples were taken particular notice of; nor
was the trimness of the walks and hedges without commendation.
Miss Betsy Blubber declared herself charmed with the shady walk
by the side of the Tay, and remarked what an excellent fancy it
was to shut out the view of the river, so that you might hear the
stream without seeing it. Mr. Blubber, however, objected to the
vicinity of the hills, and Mrs. Blubber to that of the lake, which she
was sure must be extremely unwholesome.</p>

<p>'But, however various were the remarks of the family on the
particulars of their journey in detail, I found they had perfectly
settled their respective opinions of travelling in general. The
ladies had formed their conclusion that it was monstrous pleasant,
and the gentleman his that it was monstrous dear.'

<p>A correspondent is addressing the 'Mirror' on the ill effects
of listlessness, indolence, and an aversion to profitable exertion.
The writer describes his visit to a barrister without practice, who,
having been left a small competence, had relinquished his profession
to engage in literary pursuits.</p>

<p>Mr. Mordant, the literary recluse, on his friend's arrival, was
discovered cultivating his kitchen garden. The visitor is conducted
through the grounds, which had been laid out in accordance with
the owner's taste.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-447.jpg" width="360" height="104" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Near a village, on our way homewards, we met a set of countrymen
engaged at cricket, and soon after a marriage company
dancing the bride's dance upon the green. My friend, with a degree
of gaiety and alacrity which I had never before seen him display,
not only engaged himself, but compelled me likewise to engage in
the exercise of the one and the merriment of the other. In a field
before his door an old horse, blind at one eye, came up to us at
his call, and ate the remainder of the grains from his hand from
which he had previously fed a flock of tame pigeons.</p>

<p>'Our conversation for that evening, relating chiefly to the
situation of our common friends, memory of former scenes, and
other subjects as friends naturally converse about after a long
absence, afforded me little opportunity of gratifying my curiosity.
Next morning I arose at my wonted early hour, and stepping into
his study found it unoccupied. Upon examining a heap of books
and papers that lay confusedly mingled on the table and the floor,
I was surprised to find that by much the greater part of them, instead
of metaphysics and morals (the branches connected with his
scheme of writing), treated of <i>Belles Lettres</i>, or were calculated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
merely for amusement. There was, besides, a journal of his occupations
for several weeks, from which, as it affords a picture of
his situation, I transcribe a part:&mdash;</p>

<p>'"<i>Thursday, eleven at night.&mdash;Went to bed: ordered my servant
to wake me at six, resolving to be busy all next day.</i></p>

<p>'"<i>Friday morning.&mdash;Waked a quarter before six; fell asleep
again, and did not wake till eight.</i></p>

<p>'"<i>Till nine read the first act of Voltaire's 'Mahomet,' as it was
too late to begin serious business.</i></p>

<p>'"<i>Ten.&mdash;Having swallowed a short breakfast, went out for a
moment in my slippers. The wind having left the east, am engaged
by the beauty of the day to continue my walk. Find a situation by

in the journal).</p>

<p>'"<i>Tuesday.&mdash;Waked at seven; but, the weather being rainy and
threatening to confine me all day, lay till nine&mdash;ten, breakfasted and

<p>'A few days' residence with him showed me that his life was in
reality, as is here represented, a medley of feeble exertions,
indolent pleasures, secret benevolence, and broken resolutions.
Nor did he pretend to conceal from me that his activity was not
now so constant as it had been; but he insisted that he still
could, when he thought proper, apply with his former vigour, and
flattered himself that these frequent deviations from his plan of
employment, which in reality were the fruit of indolence and
weakness, arose from reason and conviction.</p>

<p>'"<i>After all</i>," said he to me one day, when I was endeavouring
to undeceive him, "<i>after all, granting what you allege, if I be
happy, and really am so, what more could activity, fame, or preferment
bestow upon me?</i>"</p>

<p>'After a stay of some weeks I departed, convinced that his
malady was past a cure, and lamenting that so much real excellence
and ability should be thus in a great measure lost to the world, as
well as to their possessor, by the attendance of a single fault.'

<p>The following letter is from a dweller in the country, an
ardent lover of retirement, who is enchanted with the simplicity of
life and incident to be encountered in a pastoral retreat:&mdash;</p>

<p>'My dear Sir,&mdash;The moment I found myself disengaged from
business, you know I left the smoke and din of your blessed city,
and hurried away to pure skies and quiet at my cottage.</p>

<p>'You must have heard that our spring was singularly pleasant;
but how pleasant it was <i>you</i> could not feel in your dusky atmosphere.
My sister remarked that it had a faint resemblance to the
spring of &mdash;&mdash;. Although I omit the year, you may believe that
several seasons have passed away since that animating era recollected
by my sister. "Alas! my friend," said I, "seasons return,
but it is only to the young and the fortunate." A tear started in
her eye, yet she smiled and resumed her tranquillity.</p>

<p>'We sauntered through the kitchen-garden, and admired the
rapid progress of vegetation. "Everything is very forward," said
my sister; "we must begin to bottle <i>gooseberries</i> to-morrow."
"Very forward, indeed," answered I. "This reminds me of the
young ladies whom I have seen lately&mdash;they seem forward enough,
though a little out of season too."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span></p>

<p>'It was a poor witticism, but it lay in my way, and I took it
up. Next morning the gardener came to our breakfasting-parlour.
"Madam," said he, "all the gooseberries are gone." "Gone!"
cried my sister; "and <i>who</i> could be so audacious? Brother, you
are a justice of the peace; do make out a warrant directly to search
for and apprehend. We have an agreeable neighbourhood, indeed!
the insolence of the rabble of servants, of low-born, purse-proud
folks, is not to be endured." "The gooseberries are not away,"
continued the gardener; "they are lying in heaps under the
bushes; last night's frost, and a hail-shower this morning, have
made the crop fail." "The crop fail!" exclaimed my sister; "and
where am I to get gooseberries for bottling?" "Come, come,
my dear," said I; "they tell me that in Virginia pork has a
peculiar flavour from the peaches on which the hogs feed; you
can let in the goslings to pick up the gooseberries, and I warrant
you that this unlooked-for food will give them a relish far beyond
that of any green geese of our neighbours at the castle."
"Brother," replied she, "you are a philosopher." I quickly
discovered that, while endeavouring to turn one misfortune into
jest, I recalled another to her remembrance, for it seems that, by
a series of domestic calamities, all her goslings had perished.</p>

<p>'A very promising family of turkey chicks has at length

<p>'That people of sense should allow themselves to be affected
by the most trivial accident is ridiculous. There are, indeed,
some things which, though hardly real evils, cannot fail to vex the

and the daily slights to which decayed nobility is exposed.'</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">The 'Mirror.'</span>&mdash;Vol. II. No. 68.</p>

<p>'One morning during my late visit to Mr. Umphraville (the
writer of the previous letter on life in the country), as that gentleman,
his sister, and I were sitting at breakfast, my old friend John came
in, and delivered a sealed card to his master. After putting on his
spectacles, and reading it with attention, "Ay," said Umphraville,
"this is one of your modern improvements. I remember the time
when one neighbour could have gone to dine with another without
any fuss or ceremony; but now, forsooth, you must announce
your intention so many days before; and by-and-by I suppose
the intercourse between two country gentlemen will be carried on
with the same stiffness of ceremonial that prevails among your
small German princes. Sister, you must prepare a feast on
Thursday. Colonel Plum says he intends to have the honour of
waiting on us." "Brother," replied Miss Umphraville, "you
know we don't deal in giving feasts; but if Colonel Plum can
dine on a plain dinner, without his foreign dishes and French
sauces, I can prepare him a bit of good mutton, and a hearty
welcome."</p>

<p>'On the day appointed, Colonel Plum arrived, and along with
him the gay, the sprightly Sir Bobby Button, who had posted
down to the country to enjoy two days' shooting at Colonel Plum's,
where he arrived just as that gentleman was setting out for Mr.
Umphraville's. Sir Bobby, always easy, and who, in every society,
is the same, protested against the Colonel's putting off his visit,
and declared he would be happy to attend him.</p>

<p>'Though I had but little knowledge of Sir Bobby, I was
perfectly acquainted with his character; but to Umphraville he
was altogether unknown, and I promised myself some amusement
from the contrast of two persons so opposite in sentiments, in
manners, and in opinions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span></p>

<p>'When he was presented I observed Umphraville somewhat
shocked with his dress and figure, in both of which, it must be
confessed, he resembled a monkey of a larger size. Sir Bobby,
however, did not allow him much time to contemplate his external
appearance, for he immediately, without any preparation or
apology, began to attack the old gentleman on the bad taste of his
house, and of everything about it. "Why the devil," said he,
"don't you enlarge your windows, and cut down those damned
hedges and trees that spoil your lawn so miserably? If you would
allow me, I would undertake, in a week's time, to give you a
clever place." To this Umphraville made no answer; and indeed
the baronet was so fond of hearing himself talk, and chattered
away at such a rate, that he neither seemed to desire nor to expect
an answer.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-453.jpg" width="110" height="88" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'On Miss Umphraville's coming in, he addressed himself to
her, and, after displaying his dress, and explaining some particulars
with regard to it, he began to entertain
her with an account of the gallantries
in which he had been engaged the preceding
winter in London. He talked as if no
woman could resist his persuasive address
and elegant figure&mdash;as if London were one
great seraglio, and he himself the mighty
master of it.'</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">The 'Mirror.'</span>&mdash;Vol. II. No. 74.</p>

<p>'Dreams depend in part on the state of the air; that which has
power over the passions may reasonably be presumed to have
power over the thoughts of men. Now, most people know by
experience how effectual, in producing joy and hope, are pure
skies and sunshine, and that a long continuance of dark weather
brings on solicitude and melancholy. This is particularly the case
with those persons whose nervous system has been weakened by
a sedentary life and much thinking; and they, as I hinted formerly,
are most subject to troublesome dreams. If the external air can
affect the motions of so heavy a substance as mercury in the tube
of a barometer, we need not wonder that it should affect those
finer liquids that circulate through the human body.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span></p>

<p>'How often, too, do thoughts arise during the day which we
cannot account for, as uncommon, perhaps, and incongruous, as
those which compose our dreams! Once, after riding thirty miles
in a very high wind, I remember to have passed a night of dreams
that were beyond description terrible; insomuch that I at last
found it expedient to keep myself awake, that I might no more
be tormented with them. Had I been superstitious, I should
have thought that some disaster was impending. But it occurred
to me that the tempestuous weather I had encountered the preceding
day might be the occasion of all these horrors; and I have
since, in some medical author, met with a remark to justify the
conjecture.'</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Of Pastoral Poetry.</span></p>

<p>'It may be doubted whether the representation of sentiments
belonging to the <i>real</i> inhabitants of the country, who are strangers
to all refinement, or those entertained by a person of an elegant
and cultivated mind, who from choice retires into the country
with a view of enjoying those pleasures which it affords, is calculated
to produce a more interesting picture. If the former is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
recommended by its <i>naïveté</i> and simplicity, it may be expected
that the latter should have the preference in point of beauty and
variety.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-455.jpg" width="341" height="306" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'The enlargement of the field of pastoral poetry would surely
be of advantage, considering how much the common topics of
that species of writing are already exhausted. We are become
weary of the ordinary sentiments of shepherds, which have been
so often repeated, and which have usually nothing but the variety
of expression to recommend them. The greater part of the productions
which have appeared under the name of pastorals are,
accordingly, so insipid as to have excited little attention; which
is the more remarkable because the subjects which they treat of
naturally interest the affections, and are easily painted in such
delusive colours as tend to soothe the imagination by romantic

<p>'To dispute the right of fashion to enlarge, to vary, or to
change the ideas, both of man and woman kind, were a want of
good breeding, of which the author of a periodical publication,
who throws himself, as it were, from day to day on the protection
of the polite world, cannot be supposed capable.</p>

<p>'I pay, therefore, little regard to the observations of some
antiquated correspondents who pretend to set up what they call
the invariable notions of things against the opinions and practice
of people of condition.</p>

<p>'I am afraid that Edinburgh (talking like a man who has
travelled) is but a sort of mimic metropolis, and cannot fairly
pretend to the same license of making a fool of itself as London
or Paris. The circle, therefore, taking them <i>en gros</i>, of our
fashionable people here, have seldom ventured on the same
beautiful irregularity in dress, in behaviour, or in manners that
is frequently practised by the leaders of <i>ton</i> in the capital of France
or England.</p>

<p>'With individuals the same rule of subordination is to be
observed, which, however, persons of extraordinary parts, of
genius above their condition, are sometimes apt to overlook. I
perceive, in the pit of the play-house, some young men who have
got fuddled on punch, as noisy and as witty as the gentlemen in
the boxes who have been drinking Burgundy; and others, who
have come sober from the counter
or writing-desk, give almost as
little attention to the play as men
of 3,000 l. a year. My old school
acquaintance, Jack Wou'd-be,
t'other morning had a neckcloth
as dirty as a lord's, and picked
his teeth after dinner, for a quarter
of an hour, by the assistance of
the little mirror in the lid of his
tooth-pick case. I take the first opportunity of giving him a
friendly hint, that this practice is elegant only in a man who
has made the tour of Europe.'

<p>'There is a species of animal, several of whom must have
fallen under the notice of everybody present, which it is difficult
to class either among the witty or the foolish, the clever or the
dull, the wise or the mad, who, of all others, have the greatest
propensity to figure-making. Nature seems to have made them
up in haste, and to have put the different ingredients, above
referred to, into their composition at random. Here there is
never wanting a junta of them of both sexes, who are liked or
hated, admired or despised, who make people laugh, or set them
asleep, according to the fashion of the time or the humour of the
audience, but who have always the satisfaction
of talking themselves, or of being talked of by
others. With us, indeed, a very moderate
degree of genius is sufficient for this purpose;
in small societies folks are set agape by small
circumstances. I have known a lady here
contrive to make a figure for half the winter on
the strength of a plume of feathers, or the
trimming of a petticoat; and a gentleman make shift to be thought
a fine fellow, only by outdoing everybody else in the thickness of
his <i>queue</i>, or the height of his foretop.'</p>

<p>A student of 'good parts' has accepted, for one year, the post
of resident tutor to a young gentleman with rich expectations. He
writes to the 'Mirror,' describing the little progress he can make
in the advancement of his pupil's education, owing to the frivolous
interruptions which postpone serious application from day to day.
Study has been already set aside, on various pretexts, for the first
four days of the week. The close of his letter relates how he fared
on the Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>'"You must know," says Mrs. Flint, the gentleman's mamma,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
at breakfast, "that I am assured that Jemmy is very like the
Count de Provence, the King of France's own brother. Now
Jemmy is sitting for his picture to
Martin, and I thought it would be
right to get the <i>friseur</i>, whom you
saw last night [he has just arrived
from Paris], to dress his hair like
the Count de Provence, that Mr.
Martin might make the resemblance
more complete. Jemmy has been
under his hands since seven o'clock. Oh, here he comes!"
"Is it not charming?" exclaimed Miss Juliana. "I wish your
future bride could see you," added the happy mother. My pupil,
lost in the labyrinth of cross curls, seems to look about for
himself. "What a powdered sheep's head have we got here?"
cried Captain Winterbottom. We all went to Mr. Martin's to
assist him in drawing Jemmy's picture. On our return, Mrs.
Flint discovered that her son had got an inflammation in his right
eye by looking steadfastly on the painter. She ordered a poultice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
of bread and milk, and put him to bed; so there was no more
talk of "Omnibus in terris" for that evening.</p>

<p>'My pupil came down to breakfast in a complete suit of
black, with weepers, and a long mourning-cravat. The Count de
Provence's curls were all demolished, and there remained not a
vestige of powder on his hair. "Bless me!" cried I, "what is the
matter?" "Oh, nothing," said Mrs. Flint; "a relation of mine is
to be interred at twelve, and Jemmy has got a burial letter. We
ought to acknowledge our friends on such melancholy occasions,
I mean to send Jemmy with the coach-and-six; it will teach him
how to behave himself in public places."</p>

<p>'At dinner my pupil expressed a vehement desire to go to the
play. "There is to be 'Harlequin Highlander,' and the blowing
up of the St. Domingo man-of-war," said he; "it will be vastly
comical and curious." "Why, Jemmy," said Mrs. Flint, "since
this is Saturday, I suppose your tutor will have no objection; but
be sure to put on your great coat, and to take a chair in coming
home." "I thought," said I, "that we might have made some progress
at our books this evening." "Books on Saturday afternoon!"
cried the whole company; "it was never heard of." I yielded to
conviction; for, indeed, it would have been very unreasonable to
have expected that he who had spent the whole week in idleness
should begin to apply himself to his studies on the evening of
Saturday.'</p>

<p>The editor is enlarging on certain vanities and fashionable
absurdities which town people, when they rusticate for change of
air, cannot forbear importing with them.</p>

<p>'In the first place, I would beg of those who migrate from the
City not to carry too much of the town with them into the country.
I will allow a lady to exhibit the newest-fashioned cut in her
riding-habit, or to astonish a country congregation with the height
of her head-dress; and a gentleman, in like manner, to <i>sport</i>, as
they term it, a grotesque pattern of a waistcoat, or to set the
children agape by the enormous size of his buckles. These are
privileges to which gentlemen and ladies may be thought to have
entitled themselves by the expense and trouble of a winter's residence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
in the capital. But there is a provoking though a civil sort
of consequence such people are apt to assume in conversation
which, I think, goes beyond the just prerogative of
<i>township</i>, and is, a very unfair encroachment
on the natural rights
of their friends and relations in the
country. They should consider that
though there are certain subjects of
<i>ton</i> and fashion on which they may
pronounce <i>ex cathedrâ</i> (if I may be
allowed so pedantic a phrase) yet
that, even in the country, the senses
of hearing, seeing, tasting, and
smelling may be enjoyed to a certain
extent, and that a person may like or dislike a
new song, a new lutestring, a French dish, or an Italian perfume,
though such person has been unfortunate enough to pass last
winter at a hundred miles' distance from the metropolis.'</p>

<p>The editor is recounting a deeply sentimental story, written
with all seriousness, in a style sufficiently burlesque and laughable.
It refers to the love of Sir Edward, an English gentleman, who,
while travelling in Piedmont, had met with an accidental fall from
his horse, and been carried to the residence of a small proprietor
named Venoni, for whose daughter the baronet immediately conceived
a tenderness, which was returned by the fair Louisa.</p>

<p>'The disclosure of Sir Edward's passion was interrupted by
the untoward arrival of Louisa's parent, accompanied with one of
their neighbours, a coarse, vulgar, ignorant man, whose possessions
led her father to look upon him with favour. Venoni led
his daughter aside, told her he had brought her future husband,
and that he intended they should be married in a week at furthest.</p>

<p>'Next morning Louisa was indisposed, and kept her chamber.
Sir Edward was now perfectly recovered. He was engaged to go
out with Venoni; but before his departure he took up his violin,
and touched a few plaintive notes on it. They were heard by
Louisa.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span></p>

<p>'In the evening she wandered forth to indulge her sorrows
alone. She had reached a sequestered spot, where some poplars
formed a thicket, on the banks of a little stream
that watered the valley. A nightingale was
perched on one of them, and had already begun
its accustomed song. Louisa sat down on a
withered stump, leaning her cheek upon her
hand. After a little while, the bird was scared
from its perch, and flitted from the thicket. Louisa rose from
the ground, and burst into tears. She turned&mdash;and beheld Sir
Edward. His countenance had much of its former languor; and,
when he took her hand, he cast on the earth a melancholy look,
and seemed unable to speak his feelings.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-461.jpg" width="304" height="217" alt="" />
</div>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>'Louisa was at last overcome. Her face was first pale as
death, then suddenly it was crossed with a crimson blush. "Oh,
Sir Edward!" she said. "What&mdash;what would you have me do?"
He eagerly seized her hand, and led her reluctant to the carriage.
They entered it, and, driving off with furious speed, were soon out
of sight of those hills which pastured the flocks of the forsaken
Venoni.'

</p>

<p>Although Thackeray must go
down to posterity as an author,
and, of necessity, in that character
will hold his own as one of the
very greatest of English writers,
his earnest ambition sought occupation
in the career of an artist,
and, as must be familiar to
our readers, the desire for this distinction retained its hold on
his spirit through life.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-462.jpg" width="171" height="112" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As a humorous designer we must accord him a position of eminence,
and the characteristic originality of his pencil certainly
entitles Thackeray to an honourable place in the front rank of
fanciful draughtsmen.</p>

<p>The illustrations which he supplied in profusion
for the embellishment of his own writings have a
certain happy harmony with the thread of the story,
which probably no other hand could have contributed.
In the field of design, especially of the
grotesque order, his imagination was singularly fertile,
and the little figures with which he loved to
appositely point the texts of his week-day sermons
and moralities strike forcibly by their ingenuity and
by the aptness of their conception.</p>

<p>'He draws well,' insists the author of an unusually thoughtful
and sound paper on Thackeray;<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
 'his mouths and noses, his feet,
his children's heads, all his ugly and queer "mugs," are wonderful
for expression and good drawing. With beauty of man or woman
he is not so happy; but his fun is, we think, even more abounding
and funnier in his cuts than in his words. He is, as far as we can
recollect, the only great author who illustrated his own works.
This gives a singular completeness to the result. When his pen
has said its say, then comes his pencil and adds its own felicity.'</p>

<p>The article just referred to, which we cannot recommend too
highly, is written in a spirit of such just excellence as could only
have been arrived at after long personal acquaintance with Thackeray's
higher qualities. The same number contains the facsimile
of a remarkably clever and characteristic pen-and-ink drawing in
the humourist's best style, which was originally sent to a friend in
the North in place of a letter&mdash;a practice not unusual with him.
One corner of the little picture contains a 'memorandum of account'
to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
'To a new plum-coloured coat.</p>

<p class="center">'<span class="smcap">Dr. Goldsmith</span> (Mitre Court). To <span class="smcap">J. Filby</span>, Dr.'</p>
</div>

<p>Oliver Goldsmith and Dr. Johnson are both passing the shop-front
of the unfortunate tailor. The actors in this comedietta are so
absorbed in their several occupations&mdash;the lexicographer in a
book, Goldy in self-admiration&mdash;that they don't notice the tailor,
who, too, is completely paralysed at the double spectacle of his
coat and his debtor; his assistant is grinning with both his sides&mdash;the
consequence of the passing of the customer and the discomfiture
of his master, who looks somewhat of a 'grinder;' while
a pair of arch-faced, merry little urchins are copying to the life the
shuffle and swagger respectively of the two Doctors. We will let
the paper speak for itself:&mdash;</p>

<p>'This drawing is a good specimen of his work; it tells its own
story, as every drawing should. Here is the great lexicographer,
with his ponderous shuffling tread, his thick lips, his head bent
down, his book close to his purblind eyes, himself <i>totus in illo</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
reading, as he fed, greedily and fast. Beside him simpers the
clumsy and inspired Oliver, in his new plum-coloured coat; his eyes
bent down in an ecstasy of delight, for is he not far prouder of his
visage&mdash;and such a visage!&mdash;and of his coat than of his artless
genius? We all know about that coat, and how Mr. Filby never
got paid for it. There he is behind his window, in sartorial
posture; his uplifted goose arrested, his eye following wistfully,
and not without a sense of glory and dread, that coat and man.
His journeyman is grinning at him; he is paid weekly, and has no
risk. And then what a genuine bit of Thackeray, the street-boy
and his dear little admiring sister!&mdash;there they are stepping out
in mimicry of the great two.'</p>

<p>The article from which this passage is quoted contains a letter,
full of grave feeling and sensibility, which Thackeray wrote, in
1848, in acknowledging one of those spontaneous expressions of
gratitude that are occasionally found to cheer an author on his
way, and to awaken in his mind the encouraging sense of sympathy
from unexpected quarters.</p>

<p>'There happened to be placed in the window of an Edinburgh
jeweller a silver statuette of "Mr. Punch," with his dress <i>en rigueur</i>
his comfortable and tidy paunch, with all its buttons; his hunch;
his knee-breeches, with their ties; his compact little legs, one foot
a little forward; and the intrepid and honest, kindly little fellow
firmly set on his pins, with his customary look of up to and good
for anything. In his hand was his weapon, a pen; his skull was
an inkhorn, and his cap its lid. A passer-by&mdash;who had long been
grateful to our author, as to a dear unknown and enriching friend,
for his writings in "Fraser" and in "Punch," and had longed for
some way of reaching him and telling him how his work was
relished and valued&mdash;bethought himself of sending this inkstand
to Mr. Thackeray. He went in, and asked its price. "Ten
guineas, sir." He said to himself, "There are many who feel as I
do; why shouldn't we send it up to him? I'll get eighty several
half-crowns, and that will do it" (he had ascertained there would
be discount for ready money). With the help of a friend, the
half-crowns were soon forthcoming, and it is pleasant to remember
that in the "octogint" are the names of Lord Jeffrey and Sir
William Hamilton, who gave their half-crowns with the heartiest
good-will. A short note was written, telling the story. The little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
man in silver was duly packed and sent, with the following
inscription round the base:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
'GULIELMO MAKEPEACE THACKERAY.<br />
ARMA VIRUMQUE<br />
GRATI NECNON GRATÆ EDINENSES<br />
LXXX.<br />
D. D. D.'</p>

<p>How far Thackeray would have succeeded as an illustrator of
other men's thoughts there is but little that has been published to
prove. His separate cuts in 'Punch' are remarkably happy and
droll, but they have none of those graver and more aspiring qualities
which authors perhaps might have looked for in the sketches
of a young gentleman who proposed seriously to draw pictures for
their stories. It is conceded that for the embellishment of his own
writings Thackeray's eye, hand, and pencil possessed every desirable
qualification; and it is not improbable that the same facilities
would have enabled him to offer to others, as his powers became
matured, a share of the advantages which his ready wit brought to
his own pictorial embellishments.</p>

<p>The few instances of his productions as an illustrator, pure and
simple, are too early to come under fair criticism. Before he had
acquired practice with his etching-needle, and certainly before he
had found out his own particular style, he tried his hand at a set
of copper plates, with the example of Seymour, it is believed, to
guide his then imperfect knowledge of the art by means of which
he desired to publish his designs.</p>

<p>The admirable series of 'Men of Character,' which Douglas
Jerrold originally contributed as magazine papers, were collected
in three volumes and published by Colburn in 1838. These
volumes were illustrated with several plates, the humour of which
is undeniable, although it may be thought that the subjects have
suffered in execution. The name of the artist does not appear,
but there is no doubt that Thackeray supplied these designs to
adorn the book of his friend and fellow <i>littérateur</i>; the incidents
selected are all sufficiently farcical for humorous delineation, and
that they have certainly had at the hands of the draughtsman.</p>

<p>'The Practical Philosophy of Adam Buff' (the Man without
a Shirt) is completely set out in the frontispiece, where, soused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
with water, the moral professor is invited by a 'rough' to strip
'to his shirt' and show his skill with his fists. Buff's coat is
buttoned to the chin, to conceal the absence of his linen, and with
his huge shoulder of mutton hands he is striking the attitude of
immovable moral dignity which won the heart of his patron. A
likeness to this identical pugilistic coal-whipper will be found in
one of Thackeray's wood-cuts to the 'Town and Gown Row' in
'Codlingsby' ('Punch's Prize Novelists'). The 'Fall of Pippins'
represents that too susceptible youth on his knees before his lady
mistress, whom he has awakened with a kiss. The indignation of
the outraged fair, the abject terror and contrition of Pippins, the
fury of the jealous husband, Sir Scipio Mannikin, who is breaking
in upon the transgressor with uplifted cane, and the startled faces
of the domestic chaplain and his followers, are all successfully
indicated. From bad to worse, we next find 'Job Pippins&mdash;Murderer.'
The unfortunate youth, labouring under a very unpleasant
suspicion, has been dragged into still more objectionable
company; he is nervously seated on the edge of a stool, in a hut
tenanted by burglars and cut-purses. A young girl, the mistress
of a highwayman, captain of the gang, has one of those pretty,
innocent faces Thackeray always expressed so successfully.</p>

<p>'Jack Runnymede's Dream' is perhaps the most indicative of
the artist's vein of grotesque humour. This champion of the
'rights of an Englishman' had a peculiar dream before commencing
a suit at law. He fancied the Father of Evil met him
by the wayside, performing like a shepherd on his pipe, and
tendered him a 'little pup.' The Satanic person is set forth with
great imaginative attractiveness, and the convolutions of his tail
are very elaborate.</p>

<p>'John Applejohn's Humane Intentions' are displayed just at
the very instant they were most liable to uncharitable misinterpretation,
for he is caught, on his knees, with a bunch of keys, evidently
in the act of lock-picking. 'Maximilian Tape before the
Lords,' represents the little journeyman tailor just as he was
captured by those promising slips of the aristocracy, Lord Slap,
Tom Rumpus, young Plucky, and Rowdow; while one of the
party is breaking a plate over his affrighted head that he may
prove his trade by stitching it together again. 'Mr. Cramlington,'
Applejohn's master, in his borrowed locks and whiskers, the son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
of Tape's employer, a West End outfitter, who has got introduced
to this fine, improving society, under the assumption of being a
'man of fashion,' is looking on the scene in ill-concealed dread of
his own recognition and exposure.</p>

<p>In the 'Final Reward of John Applejohn,' that unfortunate
but well meaning, simple youth, just captured from the front of a
booth, and still in the dress of a statue, in which character he
narrowly escaped demolition, is restored to the "girl of his heart."</p>

<p>'Barnaby Palms Feeling his Way' is shown, the epitome of
artfulness, at the breakfast-table of his worthy uncle, where he is
taking his last meal before setting out to seek his fortune in the
world. The wily youth insisted on eating a stale egg, declaring he
'did not care for his eggs over-fresh,' in order to win the heart of
his relative, before whom is displayed a well-filled money-bag&mdash;Barnaby's
anticipated 'start in life.' It may be remembered that
the uncle expressed his earnest conviction that a man 'who did
not care for his eggs over-fresh' was sure to make his way by
himself, and so sent Barnaby forth without the coveted money-bag.</p>

<p>'Cheek's Introduction to a New Subject' represents the prison-yard,
where the dwarf artist and modeller, Mr. Pop, is maliciously
enjoying the spectacle of his employer, Cheek, the waxwork showman,
in a state of horror, with his hand locked in the fist of Kemp,
the murderer, whose head they have come down to 'take off'
after execution. 'The Ghost of Kemp' represents Aaron, the Jew
fence, waking from his guilty slumbers to discover the murderer's
head, which Pop has modelled and placed for security on the
window-sill, where it is suddenly disclosed by the moonlight to
the conscience-stricken and horrified 'receiver of stolen goods,'
who had congratulated himself that the hangman's noose had effectually
removed all evidence of his own guilt.</p>

<p>'Matthew Clear, the Man who Saw his Way,' is introduced in
the fatal instance of 'not seeing his way' which proved his ruin;
seated on a sofa with the artful adventuress whose fortune the
long-headed Clear flattered himself he should secure by persuading
her into a marriage. He is planted very comfortably on a little
sofa, below the simpering portrait of his bride. Julia's arms are
round the neck of the deluded Clear; on his knee is perched a
great lubberly boy, a pledge of affection to which it appears the
lady stands 'almost in the light of a mother.' Matthew, evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
lost as to 'his way,' is successfully cajoled; and Mrs. Clear's
parrot, which had been educated on board ship, is shrieking demoniacally,
'Hooked, by Jingo!'</p>

<p>The last plate illustrates the 'Introduction of Titus Trumps to
Miss Wolfe.' The confiding hero of this story, whose belief in
something 'turning up' favourable was ineradicable, is being
confronted by the peppery Baronet, Sir Jeremy Sloth, with his
daughter, the mature but impressionable Emily, when he has
actually come to pay a visit to her maid, whose relatives keep a
public-house with the sign of 'General Wolfe.'</p>

<p>These illustrations would probably have achieved more success
had the artist confined himself to the bold outline manner of
etching in which his better-known plates are executed, and in which
he early exhibited a fair proficiency. His desire to conform to
the fashion of the day (the 'Pickwick Papers' were publishing at
the time) led him to attempt a style in which he had not enjoyed
sufficient experience to qualify him to produce results which
would compare favourably with the works of older hands.</p>

<p>Another <i>jeu d'esprit</i> from his pencil, commenced somewhat
later, is considerably more in the unmistakeable Titmarshian
vein; indeed, for the force and fun of its satire, it perhaps excels
all that he ever did in the indulgence of his amazing talents for
ludicrous personalities. We refer to the series of illustrations, or
rather caricatures, suggested for the 'Whitey-brown Paper Magazine,'
which was never issued. The rarity of these <i>croquis</i>, merely
a few loose lithographed leaves, drawn by Thackeray himself, is so
excessive that it is stated that the only original copy which has
come under our notice cost the proprietor no less than forty
guineas. The entire paper, which in its intention does not differ
widely from certain of the 'Yellowplush Papers,' is directed to
ridicule the consequence of Dr. Lardner, editor of the 'Cabinet
Cyclopædia,' and his friend Sir Bulwer Lytton. It may be remembered
that the 'Literary Chronicle,' under the influence of these
gentlemen, was a pet aversion to its rival 'Fraser,' with Dr.
Maginn and Titmarsh to the front. The caricatures commence
with a 'Preface, Advertisement, or Introduction,' to which we
must briefly refer in order to bring on the scene the young gentleman
whose history is displayed in the caricatures, and who it was
stated, lest persons should fancy the ridicule directed against any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
of the writer's contemporaries, lived many thousands of years ago
in the reign of Chrononhotonthologos, King of Brentford.</p>

<p>This gentleman's name was Dionysius Diddler, and the historian
hastens to anticipate misconstruction by explaining that he
was no relation of any other Dionysius, nor indeed a native of
Brentford (though, it is confessed, Diddlers certainly abound in
that place).</p>

<p>Dionysius, who was sixty years of age and wore a wig and
false teeth, according to his biographer, came over as a young
fellow from Patland, and, finding the people of Brentford more
easily humbugged and more ignorant than any people on earth,
settled himself there, in his trade, which was that of a philosopher;
an excellent profession, by which Dionysius would have made a
pretty penny, only he spent his money in trying to be a man of
fashion, in buying clothes, and other genteel diversions.</p>

<p>In consequence of this extravagance, although his learning had
made his name famous (every one has heard of his 'Essay on the
Tea-Kettle,' his 'Remarks on Pumps,' and his celebrated 'Closet
Cyclopædia'), poor Diddler found himself one day, after forty
years of glory, turned out of his lodging, without a penny, without
his wig&mdash;which, sad to say, he had pawned&mdash;without even
his false teeth, which, seeing he had no use for them, he had
pawned too.</p>

<p>The first sketch pictures Dionysius Diddler, young, innocent,
and with a fine head of hair, on which he wears an old felt hat and
band very much out of shape. He wears a clerical-cut buttoned-up
vest; a bob-tail coat, very short in the waist and sleeves, and
long in the sparrow-tails; his face (an admirable likeness of the
Doctor is preserved throughout) is adorned with 'specs;' his
'brogues' are very short, and patched; his shoes are decidedly
primitive; a 'shellalee' is playfully twirled in his right hand; under
his left arm is his learned library, for he is a young student of Ballybunion
University, which noble foundation is seen under the hedge
shown in the veracious artist's background, and, we are sorry to
think, the famous college looks very like a bog-hut with a hole in
the roof to let the smoke through. In contrast to this bright
image of his gallant youth is the picture of the Doctor, after forty
years of fame, thrown on the world very lean and miserable; the
crown of his famous old felt hat is flopping down behind, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
brim is very limp and ragged; his stock is buttoned close, as is
what remains of his coat, for vest or linen he has none. Elbows
are out, so are arm-pits; tails are mere fringe, trousers to match,
and oh, such dreadful, shapeless, soleless old bluchers, and, we are
afraid, no socks!</p>

<p>Poor old Diddler, with a paper bag on his head in place of his
wig, with his face sunken in for the want of his teeth, with his old
bludgeon in one hand, and the other exposing the ragged remains
of a bottomless pocket, is looking wistfully out of his old barnacles,
as he thinks of dear Ballybunion. 'I'm femous,' he is soliloquising,
'all the wurrrld over; but what's the use of riputetion? Look at
me, with all me luggage at the end of me stick&mdash;all me money in
me left-hand breeches pocket&mdash;and it's oh! but I'd give all me
celibrity for a bowl of butthermilk and petaties.'</p>

<p>A happy thought strikes the Doctor in this strait. He goes off
to see what his publisher will do for him; and the next view we
have of poor Dionysius is more cheerful. He is in the shop of Mr.
Shortman; 'an' sure an' ouns!' Diddler's face wears the most
gratified smile possible to be produced without teeth. His roofless
hat is on the floor; the state of the top makes it hold his
'shellalee' all the more conveniently. On the shelves, sure
enough on the book-shelves, is the 'Closet Cyclopædia;' and leaning
over the counter, on which he has just laid down three five-pound
notes and three sovereigns for the delighted Dionysius to
sweep up, is the eminent publisher, white neckcloth and all, in his
habit as he lived; a capital caricature likeness of the head of the
firm of Longman and Co.</p>

<p>Diddler rapidly turns his money to account in reinstating himself
as an elegant member of society and art&mdash;the man of fashion
the rogue longed to be. The first thing he does is to take his wig
out of pawn. Here the artist has shown him in the Lombardian
counting-house; and, while his 'relative' is examining certain
securities (in the way of personal garments) upon which some of
his clients in the private boxes desire advances, our fashionable
Doctor takes the opportunity of readjusting before a looking-glass
his head of hair, which has suffered somewhat by recent incarceration,
his fingers being converted into curling-tongs to replace in
some degree its pristine splendour.</p>

<p>'And now,' says he, 'I'll go, take a sthroll to the Wist Ind, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
call on me frind Sir Hinry Pelham.' It appears that the noble
Baronet's West End residence is situated in a neighbourhood no
less celebrated than 'famed Red Lion's fashionable Square.' We
are offered a jaunty back view of the revived dandy Diddler, as
with a swagger of considerable sprightliness, and a genteel comedy
strut, he is endeavouring to carry off the impression of his ragged
wardrobe, and make the holes in his elbows pass current as a light,
airy fashion. The imposing wig is made the most of; one massive
lock, like a whisk of tow, is elegantly brushed about four inches
beyond one ear, while the famous limp white hat, with its black
band, and the top flapping about like the lid of a milk-pail, is
cocked over the other. Carriages in the distance, with footmen
suspended in pairs to the splashboard behind, attest the highly
respectable character of the vicinity.</p>

<p>Sir Hinry Pelham is fortunately at home, reposing in a sumptuous
easy chair, and splendidly apparelled in a long black satin
stock, a flowing dressing-gown with collars and cuffs of some
gorgeous material, and pointed Turkish slippers. The Baronet's
fashionable exterior is very characteristic; his hair is thrown back
in a rich cataract, over the back of his stock, his full curled whiskers
ambrosially droop below his chin, his brow is noble, his eyebrow
arched, his eye is haughty, as is his fine-bridged and well-defined
hook-nose. This tremendous lion is evidently just roused from a
state of well-bred listlessness, and he is propped up on the elbows
of his lounge, while he regards, with sleepy astonishment, a banknote
which his friend is flourishing before him with an air.</p>

<p>Diddler has thrown his hat on the floor, thrust his stick
through the opening in the top, and drawn up a chair upon which
he is straddling his long body and little legs in a consequential
and impressive attitude. 'Pelham, me boy,' says he, 'you have
clothes, and I have cridit; here's a five-pound note, and rig me
out in a new shoot.'</p>

<p>In the next plate, Pelham, solacing himself with a cigar, is
modestly concealing his features in a magazine; while Diddler&mdash;having
discarded his shocking old clothes, which, with his vagabond
hat and stick, lie scattered about the Baronet's splendid apartments&mdash;is
ensconsing himself in one of Pelham's fashionable
'shoots;' a large cheval-glass discreetly marks the operations of
his toilet. 'Fait,' says Diddler, 'the what-d'ye-call-'ems fit me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
like a glove.' Pelham is still engaged with his cigar and book in
the following plate, but his aristocratic profile is again displayed.
Diddler is standing in front of the cheval-glass contemplating with
increased satisfaction his improved and respectable appearance;
in fact, he is dressed in one of the Baronet's suits, the very height
of the <i>mode</i>. His wig is now in curl, a few handsome locks are
brushed over his forehead, a curl or two over his ears, and a row of
curls over his stock behind. His spectacles, which he never abandons,
beam with satisfaction, and his teeth are evidently replaced.
He has a black satin stock very high in the neck, and falling into
a creasy, shiny avalanche below; his coat has a broad collar,
sleeves cut quite tight from the elbow, and snowy wristbands. With
one hand he is affectedly adjusting his shirt-collar, while he
admires the reflected effect of the other, displayed in an attitude
with his thumb in the pocket of his spotless white vest; light
trousers, literally fitting like a glove, as was then the fashion,
setting tightly over a pair of narrow boots with extravagantly
lengthened toes and high heels, which complete the costume of
this elegant old dandy.</p>

<p>'And upon me honour and conshience,' says he, 'now I'm
dthressed, but I look intirely ginteel.'</p>

<p>In the last cut which has reached us we see the exterior of Sir
Hinry's noble mansion, in Red Lion Square. The dandy Doctor,
dressed in Pelham's coat, hat, boots, and pantaloons, stock, and
spurs, is mistaken for the Baronet himself by Hodge, his groom,
who leads round Pelham's horse, and, holding the stirrup, respectfully
invites Dionysius to mount; and Diddler is shown in the
picture generously dropping a coin into the cap of the groom, who
with his disengaged hand is scratching his shock-head with astonishment.
His face is a study of comical surprise, his knees are
shaking with fright; and as the Doctor rides away, like the dashing
blade he evidently considers himself, fear seizes upon the soul of
Hodge. Says he, 'That gemman cannot be my master, for, as he
rode away, he gave me sixpence, and my dear master never gives
me nothen.'</p>

<p>Another capital plate introducing Bulwer and Lardner appeared
in the collection of 'Comic Tales,' already mentioned in this
volume, and published by Cunningham (1841), for which the
author draws a fresh series of illustrations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span></p>

<p>The caricature in question accompanies Mr. Yellowplush's
'Ajew,' the opening of which is extremely droll and clever. The
two 'eminent gents' have just got out of their fly and are making
their entrance at the house of Sir John, who, as a Whig Baronet,
receives 'littery pipple;' poor Yellowplush is holding the door
for these 'fust of English writers,' and very much amazed he
looks. Although the etching is small, the likenesses are carefully
worked out; the figure of Bulwer in the 'Whitey-brown Papers'
has all the characteristics, slightly heightened, already given, except
that he wears a suit of evening dress&mdash;'a gilt velvet waistcoat,'
with his wristbands turned over the cuffs of his coat, and very
tight gloves. The little Doctor has thrust his arm under the wing
of his friend, who struts very affectedly in his close-fitting clothes,
to exhibit to advantage his small waist and falling shoulders.
Lardner's wig is perhaps richer in curls, his spectacles more beaming,
his simper more satisfied; he is adjusting the collar of his
older-fashioned square-tailed coat over a striped silk vest, which
wrinkles over his rounded paunch; his queer-shaped little legs are
displayed in somewhat ill-fitting tights, strapped over silk stockings
and pumps tied with ribands.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that the announcement of the arrival of
these 'genlmn' created some confusion. The Doctor was indignant
that any one should fail to recognise so famous a celebrity,
when Mr. Yellowplush mildly asked for his name.</p>

<p>'Name!&mdash;a! now you thief o' the wurrrld,' says he, 'do you
pretind not to know <i>me</i>? Say it's the Cabinet Cyclop&mdash;&mdash;; no, I
mane the Litherary Chran&mdash;&mdash;; psha!&mdash;bluthanouns! say it's
Docthor Dioclesian Larner&mdash;&mdash;I think he'll know me now&mdash;ay,
Nid?' But Nid had slipped out of the way, being a little nervous
about the good-breeding of his friend, it is presumed.</p>

<p>The second footman passed up the name as 'Doctor Athansius
Larnder! and by the time he got to the groom of the chambers,
who made some pretensions to scholarship, the little man
was announced as '<b>Doctor Ignatius Loyola</b>!'</p>

<p>The other gentleman, when requested to give his name (it was
at the time people were talking about the eminent novelist's
chances of being made a baronet), said in 'a thick, gobbling kind
of voice':</p>

<p class="center">
'Sawedwadgeorgeearllittnbulwig;'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span></p>

<p>which rather dumfoundered Mr. Yellowplush. That accomplished
writer evidently watched the two 'littery genlmn' with interest, as
he records the gratifying fact that 'they behaved very well, and
seemed to have good appytights.'</p>

<p>The little Irishman especially distinguished himself, eating,
drinking, and talking enough for six; and, after the wine, described
how he had lately been presented at court by his friend Mr. Bulwig,
and how her gracious Majesty had desired him to tell her the
<i>bonâ fide</i> sale of the 'Cabinet Cyclopædia,' and how he had assured
her, on his honour, that it was under ten thousand.</p>

<p>The entire illustrations of these 'Comic Tales and Sketches'
are engraved with great neatness and spirit; and, in spite of their
small size, they are superior, in carefulness of execution and
attention to detail, to most of Thackeray's etchings.</p>

<p>The figure of a jester forms the frontispiece. A placard, which
nearly conceals his person, exhibits the portraits of the three celebrities
who are concerned in the work. The genteel Mr. Fitzroy
Yellowplush, in his footman's livery, with a gold-headed cane in
his right hand, has hold of one arm of the more homely Michael
Angelo Titmarsh, who is in his turn looking up to the ferocious
and colossal Major Gahagan, with whose stride he is absurdly endeavouring
to keep pace. The Major's is a truly terrific figure.
The enormous plumes of his high Polish shako, with the skull
and cross-bones in front, are waving in the breeze, as is his long
hair, his pointed moustache, and his spreading beard. His manly
chest is displayed in a tight-fitting cavalry jacket, his shapely limbs
are encased in embroidered tights and heavily tasseled Hessians, a
sabre as tall as Titmarsh reposes on his stalwart arm, and altogether
he appears some nine feet high.</p>

<p>The trio, thus marching hand in hand together, are supposed
to be on the very verge of immortality, which, in the sketch, uncommonly
resembles a precipice.</p>

<p>The other illustrations of the two small volumes, all of which
are printed in a warm sepia tint, consist of 'Mrs. Shum's Ejectment;'
Mr. Deuceace paying for his Papa's Cigars;' 'Mr. Deuceace's
disinterested Declaration;' 'Mr. Yellowplush displaying his
Credentials' (his plush garments to wit); 'Major Gahagan, from
the great portrait by Titmarsh, in the gallery of H.H. the Nawaub
of Budge Budge;' 'The Major discovering the Infidelity of Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
Chowder Loll' (where his tremendous figure is striding across the
'tattees,' through a window, into the very midst of the disconcerted
family); 'The Major's Interview with a Celebrated Character' (no
less a personage than the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, who is
on tip-toe, dressed in the historical little cocked-hat and grey coat,
trying to put his small figure more on a level with the overwhelming
Gahagan: in the background an English general of the period,
dressed in a crescent-shaped cocked-hat and plume, a tight long
coat, with swallow-tails reaching to his heels, and white ducks split
over the boots, with a telescope under his arm, is in conversation
with one of the fierce-looking French Marshals); 'The Major in
the Tent of Puttee Rouge' (a terrifying figure, disguised in black
paint, affectionately hugging a whisky-jar of considerable dimensions).</p>

<p>The episode of the 'Professor' affords the artist a favourable
subject, which he treats with full comic force&mdash;' Mr. Dando
declares his Name and Quality.' It may be remembered that the
oyster-eater has taken advantage of the absence of the proprietor
to obtain an unlimited supply of his favourite bivalves at an oyster-room,
where the mistress did not recognise her unprincipled
customer, but was even so confiding as to send out for brandy-and-water
in liberal proportion to the oysters consumed by this
scourge of supper-rooms. The unfortunate proprietor has just
returned in time to learn a description of the business which has
been done in his absence; in some fear he is bringing in his bill,
the while he is tying on his professional apron. Mr. Dando is
seated majestically on the table, according to Thackeray's picture
of the scene; swinging his legs about in a semi-intoxicated state,
and picking his teeth, in an unconcerned and self-possessed
manner, with an oyster-knife; a pile of shells, sufficient for many
grottoes, are at his feet, while the horror-stricken servants are
gathering other shells scattered around. The professor is supposed
to have just met the reasonable demand for payment made
by the deluded master of the establishment with a yell of tipsy
laughter, and the announcement that his name is <i>Dando</i>, and that
he never pays! Above his head may be read the comforting
intelligence that a great reduction is made on taking a quantity, to
which advantage Dando is very obviously entitled.</p>

<p>The last plate ('Bedford Row Conspiracy'), 'Mr. Perkins discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
in the Zoological Gardens,' depicts Mr. John Perkins
standing, with the fair Lucy Gorgon, on the parapet which surrounds
the bearpit at the Zoological Gardens. The lady's hands
are placed on the gentleman's shoulder, his arm is round her
waist, she being somewhat timid, and he is encouraging her to
jump down&mdash;into his fond arms. She obeys him, and jumps
plump into the awful presence of her aunt and guardian, Lady
Gorgon, who is at the head of a neat little train, consisting of three
Miss Gorgons, Master Gorgon, a French governess, and a footman
carrying a poodle, all of whom had listened for some minutes to
the billings and cooings of this imprudent young pair.</p>

<p>The last story reprinted in this series is 'The Fatal Boots,'
which appears without any pictures, the artist and author modestly
declaring that, as this edifying narrative originally appeared with
George Cruikshank's illustrations (in the 'Comic Almanack' for
1839), he is not inclined to provoke comparisons between the
works of that eminent designer and his own.</p>

<p>With pencil as with pen, he had the power of carrying
the mind back to the days of the early essayists, and his reconstructive
skill is remarkable when he draws the picture of the
times in which his rich fancy and his taste for antiquarian completeness
found the most delightful materials.</p>

<p>We follow the artist's quaint vein of humour and realism from
the little sketches of chivalry&mdash;the heroes of knight-errantry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
Crusaders, Saracens, and the more romantic personages&mdash;which
amused him in his boyhood,
to his spirited studies illustrative
of the days when Dick
Steele's 'Tatler' was beginning
to be talked about as a paper
which contained a very unusual
amount of entertainment,
from its whimsical combination
of sterling wit and
truth to nature. Thackeray
was peculiarly at home in the
times of Queen Anne. We
find his pencil busy reproducing
the figures of personages who moved in the world under the
early Georges; and the reign of the third George was as intimately
familiar to him, in all details of value, as if he had lived through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
the triumphs, struggles, and disasters in which his own writings
revive a stronger interest. We enjoy his researches through the
great eras of England's history, when Washington led the revolted
colonies to independence, when Pitt and
Toryism waged war in the Senate with Fox
and the friends of liberty, when the fever of
Revolution arose in France, and threatened
to infect our own land, and when the 'Corsican'
was driven down to the death.</p>

<p>Waterloo had a strong claim on Thackeray's
interest; he is partial to alluding to
the critical point of our history, as all the
reading world well knows.</p>

<p>It must be conceded that the chief incident
of 'Vanity Fair' leads up to the great
battle. References to the famous field occur
in many portions of his gossip or travels, while
figures are borrowed from this event to carry
out the arguments of his novels and lesser essays under all sorts
of circumstances.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-481-copy.jpg" width="221" height="166" alt="" />

<p>Even in 'Philip,' which deals with a later period, we are
carried back to that stirring epoch. For instance, there is that
disreputable old Gann, the tipsy father of Mrs. Brandon, whose
acquaintance we made originally in the 'Shabby Genteel Story.' It
was always a matter of doubt how this worthy came by his rank of
Captain, which was supposed to have had its rise somehow in connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
with the Spanish Legion; but, at all events, he had borne
the distinction so long, that none of his friends dreamt of investigating
the title.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-482.jpg" width="311" height="371" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The costume affected by 'bucks,' when Thackeray was a
young man of fashion, comes down to us as preserved in his
sketches as something very modish and singular, in which the
taste and style seem nearly as quaint and distant as the knee
breeches and square skirts of the last century.</p>

<p>'Titmarsh,' who had the courage to dedicate the 'Paris
Sketch-Book' to a generous French tailor, was himself an
authority on dress; and, although above all pretensions to 'faddery
and foppery,' was accustomed to scrutinise closely not only
men, but the habits they wore.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span></p>

<p>The reader may confirm what we have just said, if he will turn
to the vigorous and whimsical articles on 'Men and Coats,' which
Thackeray penned in his younger days.</p>

<p>There is a fine specimen of freedom and independence of convention
in many of Thackeray's early writings, especially in those
slashing, downright papers which Titmarsh contributed to the
magazines, chiefly from the French capital, about the 'Paris
Sketch-Book' period.</p>

<p>In those days of Bohemian license there was a fine sterling ring
about Thackeray's outspoken sentiments. In his manly freedom
he cared little whether the slashing sentences gave offence or not.</p>

<p>Criticising the paintings in the Louvre in a paper on 'Men and
Pictures,' we find the young art-student riding an audacious tournament
against conventionalisms. He takes very candid exception
to the practice of surrounding the heads of translated beings,
and particularly angels, with an invariable halo of gold leaf. He
happens to remember that stage tradition was always wont to dress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
the gravedigger in 'Hamlet' in fifteen or sixteen waistcoats, all of
which are consecutively removed; and he presumes this ancient
usage is founded on some very early custom,
real or supposititious, to depart from which
would savour of profane innovation.</p>

<p>Another favourite bent of Thackeray's
humour was the illustration of books of
fiction. He confessed he longed to write a
story-book in which generations upon generations
of schoolboys should revel with delight,
and which should be filled with the most
wonderful and mirthful pictures. The illustrations
on this and the preceding page may serve to show what
he might have done had he not more especially devoted himself
to literary work.

<p>The facile character of Thackeray's pencil was remarkable; the
numerous sketches he left, and which in all probability, from the
circumstances of their ownership, will never in our day gratify a
public who would appreciate their publication, attest his versatile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
industry. No subject came amiss to his hand; the most unsuggestive

</p>

<p>Another aspect in which it is
agreeable to contemplate Thackeray
is that of a traveller, for in
this character he must have gone
over a considerable portion of
the more interesting parts of the
world. From India to England,
in his seventh year, with that
memorable call at St. Helena,
where the youngster caught a
fugitive glimpse of the great Napoleon
in his solitary exile.</p>
<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-491.jpg" width="170" height="264" alt="" />
<p class="caption">W. M. T. on his travels</p>
</div>

<p>Little journeyings about England
between boyhood and
youth, then a stolen visit to Paris,
in a college vacation. Then the
residence at Weimar and Eberfeld,
with rovings about Germany.
Then to Paris to see the
world, to study men, manners,
and pictures; half art-student, half pursuing the art of amusing
oneself. Then a more serious application to the earlier stages of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
that somewhat lengthy road which every aspirant must plod who
would follow the artist's career.</p>

<p>Let us take up one of his travelling companions and pass a
day with the easy-working, comfortably-provided, and satirically-observant
young 'buck,' who found himself so
pleasantly at home in Louis Philippe's slightly
uncertain capital.</p>

<p>'Planta's Paris' is not the most familiar of
travelling companions, its descriptions are not
altogether modern, but the glimpse it affords
us of the French capital is curious from the
circumstance that it registers the swiftness of
change in the Centre of Pleasure. It might
be an amusing study to reproduce from its
pages the attractions of Paris in 1827, the
date of the fifteenth edition of this work;
but the stout square little book possesses a
stronger interest, as it had the advantage of
belonging to Michael Angelo Titmarsh, and
in his pocket it probably tumbled and tossed
across the Channel.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-492.jpg" width="94" height="209" alt="" />
<p class="caption">At Weimar</p>
</div>

<p>It is rather difficult to connect Mr. Titmarsh with the stereotyped
extracts of a guide-book, but the copy under consideration
was fortunately selected as a repository for the occasional sketches
suggested to the fancy of its proprietor.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-492-copy.jpg" width="126" height="149" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In those 'flying stage' days travellers booked their passage,
per coach, from the Spread Eagle, Piccadilly, to Paris. On this
service the journey from Calais to Paris
was performed by the 'Hirondelle' in
thirty hours. It was in this manner Mr.
Pogson accomplished his eventful first
journey, in the society of the fascinating
'Baronne de Florval Delval,' as set forth
in the pages of Mr. Titmarsh's 'Paris
Sketch-Book.' Mr. Titmarsh has probably
contributed the pencilling of the 'old
<i>régime</i>' personage in the margin during
the progress to the capital. Travelling caps of every order were
assumed for comfort during the jolting on the road.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Titmarsh had become a partial resident in Paris. He
might have been seen mastering the contents of the Louvre, the
Beaux Arts, and the Luxembourg;
occasionally mounting an easel and
copying a picture.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-493.jpg" width="167" height="286" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Betweenwhiles he is, we may reasonably
suppose, engaged on materials
similar to his 'Paris Sketch-Book,'
or transferring the thrilling
thoughts of Béranger into verses which
preserve the vitality of that mighty
songster. Here the young author and
his fanciful double evidently commenced
their daily promenade&mdash;we
may vainly sigh for the pleasure of
forming one of such a desirable party&mdash;but
in spirit, assisted by the sketches
which mark his progress, it is just
possible to follow the humourist.
'Planta's Paris' is produced from
his pocket to receive rapid pencil
jottings, slight but graphic, as the
subjects present themselves.</p>

<p>First, the lolling <i>ouvrier</i>, common to Paris in all seasons and
under every government, slow and shuffling, a
lounger through successive <i>régimes</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-493-copy.jpg" width="91" height="88" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We recognise the reign of the 'Citizen King'
in the person of one of his citizen soldiers, a
worthy National Guard, hurrying from commercial
allurements to practise the military duties
of a patriot.</p>

<p>At another time Mr. Titmarsh may refresh his pictorial tastes
by the inspection of M. Phillipon's latest onslaught on 'the <i>poire</i>.'</p>

<p>Here we confront M. Aubert's renowned collection of political
cartoons in the Galerie Veron-Dodat, the head-quarters of that
irrepressible army of caricaturists whose satiric shafts kept the
stout Louis Philippe in a quiver of irritation, until he swept away
the liberty of the press.</p>

<p>Before us stands a stern dissentient from any expression assailing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
the inviolability of the absolute Sovereign who cleverly misnamed
himself the 'King of the Barricades.'</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-494.jpg" width="161" height="303" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A Citizen Soldier</p>
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-494-copy.jpg" width="142" height="394" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Army</p>
</div>

<p>Here is a sketchy reminiscence of the <i>Jardin Bullier</i>, over
the water, close by the Barrière d'Enfer. We may imagine that
this recollection has been revived
by some flaring <i>affiché</i> posted on the
walls regarding a 'long night' and
the admission of 'fancy costumes'
at that traditional retreat.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-494-copy-2.jpg" width="143" height="122" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We next get a peep into a <i>cabaret</i>,
while still in pursuit of the military
train, and here the artist regales us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
with a spirited realisation of 'Mars surrendering to Bacchus,' in
a picture not unworthy of Hogarth. These gentlemen are content
to espouse the side which offers the best chance of enjoyment&mdash;a
phase not entirely extinct in the French army, and one that
has been relied on in recent instances.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-495.jpg" width="393" height="418" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These last drawings are executed with a pen, and cleverly
shaded in Indian ink.</p>

<p>Showers, sharp though short, are frequent enough in Paris.
Mr. Titmarsh, in the shelter of a 'Passage'&mdash;possibly the 'Panoramas'&mdash;seizes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
the opportunity of this enforced captivity to produce
a flying sketch of the damp world out of doors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-496.jpg" width="409" height="185" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Titmarsh has stepped for a moment into the shelter of a
church, for we here find a life-like picture of a priest bearing the
Elements.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-496-copy.jpg" width="100" height="171" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The shower is over: the sun shines brighter than ever, and
Mr. Titmarsh is tempted to trudge over to the Luxembourg. After
a few practical criticisms on the paintings, he wanders into the
quaint gardens surrounding this palace of art. His active pencil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
finds immediate employment on an ever-recurring group,
wherever <i>bonnes</i> abound there may the soldiers be found.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-497.jpg" width="318" height="307" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These little sketches are full of familiar life.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-497-copy.jpg" width="343" height="175" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>barrière</i> is passed, and Mr. Titmarsh takes a stroll in the
environs. His pencil preserves for our amusement this record of
his wanderings.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-498.jpg" width="326" height="106" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-498-copy.jpg" width="209" height="290" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We may here allude to his kindly feeling for children, whose
romps so often employed his pen. Further down the shady groves
the <i>coco</i> seller finds a customer in a <i>militaire</i>, whose tastes are simple,
or whose means do not compass a more ambitious beverage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span></p>

<p>Before he dines, Mr. Titmarsh returns to his lodgings (possibly
the very ones he occupied during the tragedy of Attwood's violent
end, described in the 'Gambler's Death'), to 'wash-in' a few
<i>croquis</i> in Indian ink; and there, we may assume, he traces on a
loose scrap of paper the whimsical outline of 'An Eastern Traveller.'</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-499.jpg" width="220" height="340" alt="" />
<p class="caption">An Eastern Traveller</p>
</div>

<p>Anon Mr. Titmarsh plunges deeper into the art career; his
aspirations lead him to Rome; there, amidst galleries, artists,
authors, models, canvases, and easels, he pursues his lively though
somewhat desultory course. Who could be more at home in the
head-quarters of the fine arts? who more popular than this kind-hearted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
keen-witted young satirist? a universal favourite, treasuring,
perhaps unconsciously, every phase of the mixed life he met
and led there. Again, as in Paris, a pure Bohemian through inclination,
and yet fond of fine sights and society, with the <i>entrée</i>
at his disposal to every circle, refined or vagabond, of the communism
of a republic of art and letters.</p>

<p>His books carry us where we will at pleasure. We can dot
about quaint Flanders with O'Dowd, Dobbin, and the English

army, on that famous Waterloo campaign; we can elect as our
travelling companion that eminent dandy, Arthur Pendennis, Esq.
We can follow Clive Newcome and quiet J. J. to the 'Congress
of Baden,' to Italy, and what not, or we can linger with 'Philip' in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
Paris. We can follow Titmarsh through all sorts of delightful
journeyings; we are assured that promising young genius was
almost an institution in Paris. He has studied Belgium and
sojourned in Holland; in 1843 he will allow us to trot over to
Ireland in his company, for a pleasant little jaunt; in 1846 our
'Fat Contributor' will suffer us to make one in a pilgrimage from
Cornhill to Cairo; in 1850 we may join the Kickleburys on the
Rhine. As to Mr. Roundabout, we may go with him where we
list&mdash;to America, if we would accept a few grateful souvenirs of
the New World; to Scotland, where our author's popularity was,
if possible, even stronger; to Switzerland, Italy, Germany, back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
Belgium and Holland, and through innumerable pleasant reminiscences

<p>Would you visit the chief sight of Ghent, who could better act
as your kindly guide, philosopher, and friend than Thackeray? for
one of the most delightfully fresh and picturesque descriptions of
the Béguine College or village at Ghent is due to the pen of
Titmarsh. In following his sketches of this miniature city of
nuns, which every worthy sightseer has visited in the early stage
of his travels, the whole place is set out before one with charms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
added, the old interest is renewed, and we are trotting around the
quiet shady courts, or are again favoured with an interview by the
superior in the 'show-parlour,' with its ledger for the names of all
the Smiths in the universe, while around are displayed the
treasures of the convent. It is not difficult to imagine Thackeray
sitting down by the roadside, rapidly making the sketches which
we give in this chapter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-506.jpg" width="224" height="320" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In 1852 Thackeray paid his first visit to America. The generous
reception accorded him throughout the States is sufficiently
notorious. Mr. W. B. Reed, who enjoyed in Philadelphia the
intimacy of the great novelist, has recorded how deeply sympathetic
was the feeling of our transatlantic cousins for this
sterling example of a thorough and honest English gentleman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
Among other tender remembrances of the kindly humourist, he
writes, hinting with delicate reserve at 'domestic sorrows and
anxieties too sacred to be paraded before the world':&mdash;</p>

<p>'In our return journey to Philadelphia, Thackeray referred to
a friend whose wife had been deranged for many years, hopelessly
so; and never shall I forget the look, and manner, and voice with
which he said to me, "It is an awful thing for her to continue so
to live. It is an awful thing for her so to die. But has it never
occurred to you, how awful a thing the recovery of lost reason
must be without the consciousness of the lapse of time? She
finds the lover of her youth a grey-haired old man, and her infants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
young men and women. Is it not sad to think of this?" As he
talked to me thus, I thought of those oft-quoted lines of tenderness&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Ah me! how quick the days are flitting;</p>
<p class="i1">I mind me of a time that's gone,</p>
<p>When here I'd sit, as now I'm sitting,</p>
<p class="i1">In this same place, but not alone.</p>
<p>A fair young form was nestled near me,</p>
<p class="i1">A dear, dear face looked fondly up,</p>
<p>And sweetly spoke and tried to cheer me&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">There's no one now to share my cup!</p>
</div></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-509.jpg" width="310" height="234" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Thackeray left us (the Philadelphians) in the winter of 1853,
and in the summer of the year was on the Continent with his
daughters. In the last chapter of the "Newcomes," published
in 1855, he says: "Two years ago, walking with my children in
some pleasant fields near to Berne, in Switzerland, I strayed from
them into a little wood; and, coming out of it, presently told
them how the story had been revealed to me somehow, which, for
three-and-twenty months, the reader has been pleased to follow."
It was on this Swiss tour that he wrote me a kindly characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
letter. On the back of this note is a pen-and-ink caricature, of
which he was not conscious when he began to write, as on turning
his paper over he alludes to "the rubbishing picture which he
didn't see." The sketch is very spirited, and is evidently the
original of one of his illustrations to his grotesque fairy tale of
the "Rose and the Ring," written (so he told a member of my
family years afterwards) while he was watching and nursing his
children, who were ill during this vacation ramble.'</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-510.jpg" width="290" height="345" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The last journey chronicled by Thackeray was a merry little
'Roundabout' trip over the old Netherlands ground, in which he
indulged, without preparation, when overworked and suffering from
the anxieties of editing the 'Cornhill Magazine;' the journal is
filled in with the zest of a stolen excursion, and the writer mentions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
that no one knew where he had gone; that there was only
one chance of a letter finding him to curtail the freedom he had
snatched, and he goes to the post, and there, sure enough, is that
summons back to the 'thorny cushion,' which abruptly cuts short
the last recorded holiday jaunt of Thackeray's life. In this last
little jaunt through Holland, the impressions of the author were as
fresh and full of pleasant observation as in those wayside sketches
noted years before.</p>

<p>The great event of the last few years of Thackeray's life was the
starting of the 'Cornhill Magazine,' the first number of which,
with the date of January 1860, appeared shortly before Christmas
in the previous year. The great success which Charles
Dickens had met with in conducting his weekly periodical perhaps
first suggested the project of this new monthly magazine, with
Thackeray for editor. But few expected a design so bold and
original as they found developed by the appearance of Number 1.
The contents were by contributors of first-rate excellence; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
quantity of matter in each was equal to that given by the old-established
magazines published at half-a-crown, while the price
of the 'Cornhill,' as everyone knows, was only a shilling. The
editor's ideas on the subject of the new periodical were explained
by him some weeks before the commencement in a characteristic
letter to his friend, G. H. Lewes, which was afterwards adopted as
the vehicle of announcing the design to the public.</p>

<p>The first number contained the commencement of that series
of 'Roundabout Papers' in which we get so many interesting
glimpses of Thackeray's personal history and feelings, and also the
opening chapters of his story of 'Lovel the Widower.' The latter
was originally written in the form of a comedy, entitled 'the Wolf
and the Lamb,' which was intended to be performed during the
management of Wigan at the Olympic Theatre, but was finally
declined by the latter. Thackeray, we believe, acquiesced in the
unfavourable judgment of the practical manager upon the acting
qualities of his comedy, and resolved to throw it into narrative
form, in the story with which his readers are now familiar. This
was not the first instance of his writing for the stage. If we are
not mistaken, the libretto of John Barnett's popular opera of the
'Mountain Sylph,' produced nearly forty years since,
was from his pen. In the 'Cornhill' also appeared
his story of 'Philip on his Way through the World.'
The scenes in this are said to have been founded
in great part upon his own experiences; and there
can be no doubt that the adventures of Philip Firmin
represent, in many respects, those of the Charterhouse
boy who afterwards became known to the world as
the author of 'Vanity Fair.' But in all such matters
it is to be remembered that the writer of fiction feels himself at
liberty to deviate from the facts of his life in any way which he
finds necessary for the development of his story. Certainly the
odious stepfather of Philip must not be taken for Thackeray's
portrait of his own stepfather, towards whom he always entertained
feelings of respect and affection.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-515.jpg" width="42" height="101" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We may also remind our readers that the 'Lectures on the
Four Georges' first appeared in print in the 'Cornhill.' The sales
reached by the earlier numbers were enormous, and far beyond
anything ever attained by a monthly magazine; even after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
usual subsidence which follows the flush of a great success, the
circulation had, we believe, settled at a point far exceeding the
most sanguine hopes of the projectors.</p>

<p>These fortunate results of the undertaking were, however, not
without serious drawbacks. The editor soon discovered that his
new position was in many respects an unenviable one. Friends
and acquaintances, not to speak of constant readers and 'regular
subscribers to your interesting magazine,' sent him bushels of manuscripts,
amongst which it was rare indeed to find one that could be
accepted. Sensitive poets and poetesses took umbrage at refusals,
however kindly and delicately expressed. 'How can I go into
society with comfort?' asked the editor of a friend at this time.
'I dined the other day at &mdash;&mdash;'s, and at the table were four gentlemen
whose masterpieces of literary art I had been compelled
to decline with thanks.' Not six months had elapsed before he
began to complain of 'thorns' in the editorial cushion. One lady
wrote to entreat that her article might be inserted, on the ground
that she had known better days, and had a sick and widowed
mother to maintain; others began with fine phrases about the
merits and eminent genius of the person they were addressing.
Some found fault with articles, and abused contributor and editor.
An Irishman threatened proceedings for an implied libel in 'Lovel
the Widower' upon ballet-dancers, whom he declared to be
superior to the snarlings of dyspeptic libellers, or the spiteful
attacks and <i>brutum fulmen</i> of ephemeral authors. This gentleman
also informed the editor that theatrical managers were in the habit
of speaking good English, possibly better than ephemeral authors.</p>

<p>It was chiefly owing to these causes that Thackeray finally
determined to withdraw from the editorship of the magazine,
though continuing to contribute to it and take an interest in its
progress. In an amusing address to contributors and correspondents,
dated March 18, 1862, he made known this determination;
and in the same address he announced that, while the tale of
'Philip' had been passing through the press, he had been preparing
another, on which he had worked at intervals for many years
past, and which he hoped to introduce in the following year.</p>

<p>In a pecuniary sense the 'Cornhill Magazine' had undoubtedly
proved a fortunate venture for its editor. It was during his
editorship that he removed from his house, No. 36 Onslow Square,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
in which he had resided for some years, to the more congenial
neighbourhood of the Palace at Kensington, that 'Old Court
Suburb' which Leigh Hunt has gossiped about so pleasantly.
Thackeray took upon a long lease a somewhat dilapidated mansion,
on the west side of Kensington Palace Gardens. His intention
was to repair and improve it, but he finally resolved to pull it
down and build another in its stead. The new house, a handsome,
solid mansion of choice red brick with stone facings, was
built from a design drawn by himself; and in this house he continued
to reside till the time of his death. 'It was,' says Hannay,
'a dwelling worthy of one who really represented literature in the
great world, and who, planting himself on his books, yet sustained
the character of his profession with all the dignity of a gentleman.
A friend who called on him there from Edinburgh, in the summer
of 1862, knowing of old his love of the Venusian, playfully reminded
him of what Horace says of those who, regardless of their sepulchre,
employ themselves in building houses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i3">Sepulchri</p>
<p>Immemor struis domos.</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay," said he, "I am <i>memor sepulchri</i>, for this house will always
let for so many hundreds (mentioning the sum) a year."' We may
add that Thackeray was always of opinion that, notwithstanding
the somewhat costly proceeding of pulling down and re-erecting,
he had achieved the rare result, for a private gentleman, of building
for himself a house which, regarded as an investment of a portion
of his fortune, left no cause for regret.</p>

<p>Our narrative draws to a close. The announcement of the
death of Thackeray, coming so suddenly upon us in the very
midst of our great Christian festival of 1863, caused a shock which
will be long remembered. His hand had been missed in the last
two numbers of the 'Cornhill Magazine,' but only because he had
been engaged in laying the foundation of another of those continuous
works of fiction which his readers so eagerly expected. In
the then current number of the 'Cornhill Magazine' the customary
orange-coloured fly-leaf had announced that 'a new serial
story' by him would be commenced early in the new year; but
the promise had scarcely gone abroad when we learnt that the
hand which had penned its opening chapters, in the full prospect
of a happy ending, could never again add line or word to that
long range of writings which must always remain one of the best
evidences of the strength and beauty of our English speech.</p>

<p>On the Tuesday preceding he had followed to the grave his
relative, Lady Rodd, widow of Vice-Admiral Sir John Tremayne
Rodd, K.C.B., who was the daughter of Major James Rennell,
F.R.S., Surveyor-General of Bengal, by the daughter of the Rev.
Dr. Thackeray, Head Master of Harrow School. Only the day
before this, according to a newspaper account, he had been congratulating
himself on having finished four numbers of a new
novel; he had the manuscript in his pocket, and with a boyish
frankness showed the last pages to a friend, asking him to read
them and see what he could make of them. When he had completed
four numbers more he said he would subject himself to the
skill of a very clever surgeon, and be no more an invalid. Only
two days before he had been seen at his club in high spirits; but
with all his high spirits, he did not seem well; he complained of
illness; but he was often ill, and he laughed off his present attack.
He said that he was about to undergo some treatment which
would work a perfect cure in his system, and so he made light of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
his malady. He was suffering from two distinct complaints, one
of which had now wrought his death. More than a dozen years
before, while he was writing 'Pendennis,' the publication of that
work was stopped by his serious illness. He was brought to
death's door, and he was saved from death by Dr. Elliotson, to
whom, in gratitude, he dedicated the novel when he lived to finish
it. But ever since that ailment he had been subject every month
or six weeks to attacks of sickness, attended with violent retching.
He was congratulating himself, just before his death, on the failure
of his old enemy to return, and then he checked himself, as if he
ought not to be too sure of a release from his plague. On the
morning of Wednesday, December 23, the complaint returned, and
he was in great suffering all day. He was no, better in the evening,
and his valet, Charles Sargent, left him at eleven o'clock on
Wednesday night, Thackeray wishing him 'Good night' as he
went out of the room. At nine o'clock on the following morning
the valet, entering his master's chamber as usual, found him lying
on his back quite still, with his arms spread over the coverlet; but
he took no notice, as he was accustomed to see his master thus
after one of his severe attacks. He brought some coffee and
set it down beside the bed; and it was only when he returned
after an interval, and found that the cup had not been tasted, that
a sudden alarm seized him, and he discovered that his master was
dead. About midnight Thackeray's mother, who slept overhead,
had heard him get up and walk about the room; but she was not
alarmed, as this was a habit of her son when unwell. It is supposed
that he had, in fact, been seized at this time, and that the
violence of the attack had brought on the effusion on the brain
which, as the <i>post-mortem</i> examination showed, was the immediate
cause of death. His medical attendants attributed his death to
effusion on the brain, and added that he had a very large brain,
weighing no less than 58½ oz.</p>

<p>Thus, in the full maturity of his powers, died William
Makepeace Thackeray, one of the closest observers of human
nature, the most kindly of English humourists; and his death has
left a blank in our literature, which we, in the present generation
at least, are offered no prospect of seeing filled up. To quote
once more his friend Hannay's words: 'It is long since England
has lost such a son; it will be long before she has such another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
to lose. He was indeed emphatically English&mdash;English as distinct
from Scotch, no less than English as distinct from Continental.
The highest, purest English novelist since Fielding, he combined
Addison's love of virtue, with Johnson's hatred of cant; Horace
Walpole's lynx eye for the mean and ridiculous, with the gentleness
and wide charity for mankind, as a whole, of Goldsmith. <i>Non
omnis mortuus est.</i> He will be remembered in his succession
with these men for ages to come, as long as the hymn of praise
rises in the old Abbey of Westminster, and wherever the English
tongue is native to men, from the banks of the Ganges to those of
the Mississippi.'</p>

 Both the 'new and old Bayleys' are treated to a roasting in the <i>Comic

young writer evidently entertained but scanty respect, in <i>Fraser</i> for 1831,
where, in the November number, Oliver Yorke is supposed to hold a levee,
at which the prominent celebrities are presented to Regina's editor on various
pretences&mdash;'Old Bayley, on being sent to France,' and 'Young Bayley, after
Four Years in the West Indies,' on his arrival to present a copy of the 'Songs

 A somewhat similar circumstance happened during the delivery of the
lectures in America, an allusion in which to 'Catherine Hayes' was warmly

Catherine Hayes, the murderess of the last century.</p>
